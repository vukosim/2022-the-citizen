South Africa’s very own Mille Miglia-styled classic car event’s route will start at the V&A Waterfront, from where participants will take a scenic tour of the Western Cape for four days.  Stopovers will include Hermanus, Franschhoek and St. Helena Bay and the rally will include regularity stages, non-competitive track events and, according to the route planners Dave Alexander and Di Dougmore, “a healthy dose of grand touring.” The event categories include 1927 – 1957: Mille Miglia Specific, Pre-1977: Classic, 1977 – 1996: Modern Classic and 1997 – 2021: Sports. The Cape 1000 was announced last year, and pays homage to the historic Mille Miglia, a 1000-mile race that took place in Italy from 1927 to 1957.  The Italian race saw some of the best racers of the time battle it out on the scenic roads of Italy, with legends like Tazio Nuvolari and Stirling Moss who will forever be associated with the Mille Miglia.
