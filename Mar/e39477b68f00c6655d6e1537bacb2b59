There were some big boys there. Caf will have to look into this matter,” added Jordaan. He suggested that age cheating at youth level may be the reason African countries are failing to thrive at senior level on the world stage.  “This has been a consistent problem of African football and we have to address the issue.  “This is anti-development because if you are playing at under-16 and you are supposed to be playing in an age category much higher… it cannot be a true measure of teams on the field, especially in school competitions.”
