Coach Kgoloko doesn’t seem like someone who knows what he is doing at the moment.“I think he can also see it  because since he came back, there hasn’t been much of a change looking at the team’s results. Some people at the club believe that there is still some time to try and save the status of the team, it’s just that there are others who really believe in coach Thobejane’s work, I think they are just loyal to him because he has been with team from the start,” said the source. Johnson, who has previously coached at Platinum Stars and SuperSport United, has been without a coaching job since his departure at Al-Ahly last year.
