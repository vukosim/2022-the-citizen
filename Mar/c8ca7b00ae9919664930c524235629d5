When trainer Candice Bass-Robinson engages jockey Greg Cheyne to ride a horse, punters should pay attention. The combo have a top-four-to-runs ratio approaching 60%, which makes them always worthy of close consideration for the likes of Quartets, Trifectas and PAs. On Wednesday at Durbanville, Cheyne partners three Bass-Robinson runners and they look bang-on to underline the stats. It’s in the last two races on the card where the focus will fall. In Race 7, an 1400m MR96 Handicap, Bass-Robinson saddles two candidates, top-weight Arctic Drift and lightly weighted Dragonfly, and both will be popular choices among punters. Cheyne rides the latter, who has a 7kg pull over his stablemate and returns to his favourite distance after a good finish last time over shorter. Dragonfly does have a respiratory noise issue but has won races and finished close-up despite that. Decent handicappers line up in opposition, such as Bush Tracker, Hyde Park and Lion’s Head, but there is a sense that Dragonfly has not reached full potential, and this is a race in which he can get closer to that – specially with that big weight advantage. The team could complete the quick double in Race 8, an FM 78 Handicap over 1400m, in which the runner in question is Going Up. This Ridgemont filly won first time out on 4 September, the ease of victory over 1200m in heavy going seeing her lumped with an introductory merit rating of 85, no less. There followed a five-month pause in Going Up’s ascent, before she returned to action in February, in a handicap and again over 1200m at Kenilworth. Slow away, the three-year-old ran on strongly to finish fifth, less than a length off the winner. The extra 200m here should be perfect for the daughter of Gimmethegreenlight at this stage of her career. Earlier, the Bass-Robinson and Cheyne get together in Race 4 with High Moon, another who seems to have unrealised potential. The gelding might be looking for this 2400m and cannot be ignored in any bets.
