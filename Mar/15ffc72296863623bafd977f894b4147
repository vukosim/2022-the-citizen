George is a football player and like every other footballer, he wants to be on the pitch and has come very close to being part of the line-up in several games and making the 18-man squad.“He has to be patient in the same way that Brian Onyango was. Mothobi Mvala had to show a lot of patience and we can say the same about Devine Lunga and Aubrey Modiba,” said Mokwena.“The reality is that when you have a squad like this, you have to try and push yourself and that is what George has been doing.“He has done the most difficult thing that a footballer can do, and that is to come to training, work extremely hard, put a smile on your face, even when you know when there is a huge possibility that you might not make the squad.“That is very difficult but George does that consistently and that shows his level of experience and maturity.“Good things come to good people and I am sure that when he gets his opportunity he will most certainly grab it with both hands.”
