Fairview Turf Best Bet: Race 7: Queen Of Shadows (1) to win. This Vercingetorix filly trained by Justin Snaith shed her maiden tag on her first raid in the Eastern Cape. This time she’s contesting the feature race on the day, the Listed Breeders Guineas over 1600m. Value Bet: Race 4: Emaline (2) Eachway. One of only two fillies in the 13-runner field, she has been very inconsistent. She has, however, won twice in three outings on the Fairview Turf course.
