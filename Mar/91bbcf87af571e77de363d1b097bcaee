Muzi Yeni has been a fixture on the South African racing scene for so long, willing to ride so many horses – good, bad, indifferent – that we sometimes forget what a serious talent he is. We got a reminder at the Vaal on Tuesday when the little fella produced one of the rides of the season to win on Trust Of Fire for the Bill Human yard – leading boldly from the off, only to be headed by Richard Fourie and Toffas in the final stretch, but extracting hidden reserves of heart from the long-time maiden and get back up on the line. On Wednesday, Yeni is in Durban for a Greyville Polytrack fixture and could provide further reminders about those capabilities in the irons. His best chance seems to be on Tienie Prinsloo-trained Princess Donelly in Race 5, a FM76 Handicap over 1000m. Of course, jockey and trainer are old pals, having dominated the old Kimberley scene for years as a team, winning mutual championships in that fondly remembered league. Princess Donelly has been in super form in recent months, with three wins and two seconds in her last six outings. Interestingly, Yeni hasn’t been on board in any of those races, but the filly couldn’t want for better assistance. Yeni and Prinsloo could get the day off to a good start in the first race with Iron Chef, a filly who produced her best performance when put over much more ground than the sprints and miles she’d been contesting. Her close-up third place was over 2000m and this is a 1900m. Yeni’s other rides with potential – at good value – are Arrow’s Mark in the second and Fiery Duke in the seventh.
