Two banker bets present themselves at Tuesday’s Fairview Polytrack meeting – and, boy, do we need them. Punting is seldom easy at the Bay and this fixture is typical, with several legs of the exotics being very tricky. One of our potential saviours is Integrity in Race 5, a FM84 Handicap over 1900m. The five-year-old mare was a useful galloper when resident in Durban with Wendy Whitehead, delivering four wins in her 14 starts there. After moving down the coast to Tara Laing in January she didn’t miss a beat, form-wise, trotting up on her PE debut. That was a Pinnacle Stakes race and Integrity copped a five-point merit hike for her trouble. So, now she must carry a few more kilos, but the opposition is not quite as strong this time and, with Richard Fourie reprising his role in the saddle, she generates confidence. In the next race, the sixth, also over 1900m, Pink Legacy is the other banker candidate. She transferred as a maiden with fair Highveld form, from Mike de Kock’s care to Alan Greeff in December 2021, and was another to make light work of her local debut, with a 3.25-length victory on the Poly. Interestingly, that was a 1200m sprint, but Greeff immediately saw the staying potential and sent her over 1600m then 1800m – for a third and a second. The latter saw Pink Legacy touched off late, so she clearly has the lungs for this 1900m. With two bankers in the exotics bank, so to speak, we have room to go wide in other legs, with Race 7 requiring the net to be spread particularly widely.
