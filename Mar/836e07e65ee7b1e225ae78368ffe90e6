The special tribute of rapper Riky Rick is set to get underway at Sandton Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg this morning.  Attendance to the event was capped to a limited number of people, and those who wanted to attend had to register to get access to the web tickets. The registration and tickets quickly sold out.  The tribute is set to get underway from 10am. Friends and family of the late Rikhado “Riky Rick” Makhado gathered at Riky Rick’s funeral at the Bryanston Catholic Church in Johannesburg on Tuesday, dressed in all white to lay the late rapper to rest after his passing last week. Riky Rick died on 23 February after taking his own life. Many public figures and fans have since spoken out about mental health and the high rates of male suicides.  While reading his obituary, friend Ntokozo Dladla revealed that Riky was named Rikhado after the ‘I Love You Daddy’ singer Ricardo, due to the fact that his parents had loved the song.  “Rikhado was addicted to loving people,” added Dladla.
