Cricket South Africa and former Proteas captain Graeme Smith have joined the sporting world in mourning the passing of Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne, who died from a heart attack at the age of 52 on Friday. Warne made his debut in 1992 and played his last Test in 2007. He ended his career with 708 Test wickets. Director of cricket in South Africa and a player who played against Warne at the height of his career, Smith said: “In life you are privileged to meet people that changed the game. Shane Warne changed the game. RIP brother.” Warne was named one of Wisden’s five cricketers of the century – alongside Donald Bradman, Garfield Sobers, Jack Hobbs and Vivian Richards.
