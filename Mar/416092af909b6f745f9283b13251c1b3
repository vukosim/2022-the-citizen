DURBANVILLE BEST BET RACE 3 NO 3 ELEODORO – WIN Two runs back this daughter of Jackson finished fourth behind Peut Etre Moi, a form line that is looking particularly strong. She then finished second in her next start but that was over 1800m and she might have fund that trip a bit far at this stage of her career.
