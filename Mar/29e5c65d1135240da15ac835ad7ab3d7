The most recent episodes of the show have been setting the tone for season two, which is based on the book Zandile: The Resolute.Khanyi Mbau being cast as Zandile was heralded with the expectation that this would ramp things up and make things more interesting, but fans seem to feel the opposite has happened.The only person that fans of The Wife haven’t lost faith in is Abdul Khoza, who continues to entertain fans with his portrayal of the character Nqoba.
