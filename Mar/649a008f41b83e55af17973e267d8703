Now, however, Broos has picked the 30 year-old Masandawana left-sided player, who has shone for Sundowns this season in their DStv Premiership campaign. There was also a call-up for in-form Orlando Pirates midfielder Bandile Shandu, and for striker Fagrie Lakay, who has had a good start to his stint at Pyramids FC in Egypt. Bafana will play Guinea on June 25 in Belgium and France four days later in Lille.
