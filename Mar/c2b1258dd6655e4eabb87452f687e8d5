In the build-up to the game, veteran defender Clayton Daniels said no one expected Maritzburg United to beat defending DStv Premiership champions Mamelodi Sundowns, but the Team of Choice pulled a rabbit from a hat and snatched all three points as they beat Downs 2-1 at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday.

However, he could not celebrate his goal as he immediately went to the ground in pain after landing awkwardly. He could not continue with the match as he was withdrawn at half-time following visible discomfort.Downs then had an opportunity to restore their lead, but it was not to be. In the  84th minute, the man in the middle handed Masandawana a penalty after defender Nazier Allie handled the ball in the box. It was substitute Themba Zwane who took the responsibility but the Team of Choice’s goalie, Engelhardt, made sure that he kept his team in the game as he palmed Zwane’s spot-kick away.Ernst Middendorp moved away from the relegation quagmire as they distanced themselves from the bottom, having collected 21 points so far this season.
