It is the same at Sundowns because the coaches are evolving the team and the older players are getting little or no game time,” said a source. “Vila would not mind leaving at the end of the season if the situation does not change,” the informer added.Meanwhile, Kaizer Chiefs are said to be monitoring Vilakazi’s situation at Sundowns and could snap up the midfielder on a free transfer at the end of the season. Chiefs were heavily linked with Vilakazi prior to him joining Sundowns from Bidvest Wits in 2016, he opted to join the Brazilians instead.
