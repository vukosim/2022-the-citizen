Months of online rumours that rappers AKA, real name Kiernan Forbes, and Nadia Nakai Kandava are dating, have finally been confirmed.  The couple confirmed their relationship by going Instagram official on Friday.  Previously there was no conclusive proof of their relationship, but fans and followers of the rappers gathered their own information, which led them to believe that they might be a couple. AKA posted a boomerang video of Nadia sitting on his lap and the two sharing a kiss. He and Nadia shared the same video and captioned it: “MEGA 2 MEGA.” The two have played coy about their relationship status since December 2021, after fans put two and two together while they were vacation in the same place during the festive season.  But the clues seemed to align in February when the Bragga rapper, Nadia, shared a picture bonding and spending some time with an adorable Boston terrier that looked exactly like AKA’s dog, King Louie the 13th Forbes. She also posted a video on her Instagram story, Nadia was heard telling Louie that he is starting to become obsessed with her, and the dog was even seen grabbing Nadia’s arm when she tried to pull away from him.
