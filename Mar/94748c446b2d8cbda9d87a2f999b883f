With the reported five-door variant believed to be due later this year, Suzuki Auto South Africa has quietly made a new trim level available on the Suzuki Jimny, in the form of the GL.  Following the brand’s familiar trim grade denominators and placing, the GL, as per the brand’s website, slots-in between the carryover, entry-level GA and top-spec GLX with the main differences being the level of specification. While motivation from the 1.5 K15B petrol engine remains unchanged at 75kW/130Nm, the GL sports the option of the four-speed automatic gearbox previously only offered on the GLX. It is, however, fitted with the five-speed manual as standard. Also unchanged is the 210 mm claimed ground clearance, an approach angle of 37-degrees, 28-degree breakover angle and 47-degree departure angle.

Unlike the GA though, the GL comes as standard with a Bluetooth and USB enabled sound system, albeit without the touchscreen functionality available on the GLX.   As with the rest of the Jimny range, the GL’s sticker price includes a five-year/200 000 km warranty, but the service plan reverts to the lesser two-year/30 000 km offered on the GA.
