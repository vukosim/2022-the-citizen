His death has struck a major blow to Turfloop FC and the Ramabulana family, as the young central midfielder was the ‘pivotal cog’ to the technical team’s plans of building a club that can campaign in the GladAfrica Championship next season,” Lekganyane told Polokwane Observer, adding that the club will be sending a delegation to the player’s family. They will formally express messages of condolences on behalf of the club. Meanwhile, the club has called off its training sessions for the next two days as the players will be provided time off to deal with this tragedy,” he concluded. Ramabula’s former coach Bayano Moloto, who coached him at Molemole Football Academy and Turfloop Football Academy, described the player as a humble kid and a hard worker.  “I won a lot of trophies with him at Molemole and we are saddened by the loss. We send our condolences to his family, friends and teammates. He was a humble boy and a true leader and one of the hardest working players I have ever met,” said Ramabula’s former coach.
