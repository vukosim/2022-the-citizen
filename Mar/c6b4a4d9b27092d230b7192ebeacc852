Highveld trainers have been profitably plying the N3 to KwaZulu-Natal in recent times, sending select horses to benefit from different conditions than at home – whether it be the underfoot ease of the Greyville Polytrack or the peculiarities of Scottsville. On Monday, four upcountry conditioners are at Greyville and could come away with some decent swag. St John Gray has bright prospects in Race 4, an MR67 Handicap over 1700m. His two runners, Wondering Star and Liverpool Legend, look sure to contest the finish and are essential for Swinger, Trifecta and Quartet bets – along with the local hopes Pashtunwali and Roy’s Command. Gray’s third traveller, Sound Of Hounds in the seventh, is also a must inclusion. With two wins and a place from three starts, the three-year-old colt looks a bit special and is likely to start a short-priced favourite. Earlier in the day, Wildeye might enjoy the whiff of sea air after journeying down from trainer Johan Janse van Vuuren’s Turffontein stables. This fellow has missed prize money in only one of his eight starts and falls squarely into the “overdue” category. A tendency to hang in has so far thwarted his efforts to win, but the fitting of blinkers – along with kind going and the services of in-form Keagan de Melo in the irons – could see Wildeye crack the maiden. One of the visitors who might offer a bit of value is Clinton Binda’s Purple Shadow in Race 8, an FM 65 Handicap over 1400m. This filly has been to Durban before, breaking her maiden on the Poly in March 2021. She had a long break at the end of the year, and this is her peak run after returning to action.
