The Johannesburg High Court on Friday granted an application by the alleged mastermind behind Tshegofatso Pule’s murder to have his case reopened. The case was reopened after Ntuthuko Shoba’s legal team submitted CCTV footage to the high court as new evidence. The footage is from the night that Pule was picked up by her convicted killer, Muzikayise Malephane, from Shoba’s complex in Florida, west of Johannesburg. Shoba wants the court to consider the CCTV footage before judgment can be delivered in the murder trial. The trial wrapped up last month after state prosecutor advocate Faghre Mohammed and Shoba’s lawyer, advocate Norman Makhubela, presented their closing arguments in the matter.  Judgment was then reserved, but Shoba applied for the case to be reopened in order to sway the judge based on the CCTV footage.
