Richard Fourie is doing a bit more travelling of late, bringing a dash of panache to race riding around the country. He’s become a regular at Fairview this season and it’s paid off – for him and punters – as he currently tops the jockey standings in Eastern Cape. Could we see a national championship bid next season? On Friday, Fourie rides six horses at the Fairview turf track meeting and every one of them has a winning shout. In the main race of the day, the 1600m Breeders Guineas (Listed), the ace teams up with his sometime guv Justin Snaith, who raids from Cape Town with Queen Of Shadows. The three-year-old filly has made the up-coast trip before, in July 2021 when she won a sprint on the same turf, so shouldn’t suffer stage fright. She went on to win again back home and has been in good form in the months since, only slipping out of the placings in the Cape Fillies Guineas when she bumped some high-quality opposition. There is nothing of that class in this field and, with able assistance from the saddle, she should claim her third victory with some ease. Of Fourie’s other engagements, Jean’s Man in the third and Variety Breeze in the eighth, both for Juan Nel, are lively contenders, while Herrin in the sixth, for Alan Greeff, could offer some fair value.
