Fairview Polytrack Best Bet: Race 1 Swinger: 4-Knave of Diamond and 5-La Fille Let’s get everybody off to a winning start for the day. This is not the strongest of fields and these two runners stand out and should fight out the finish. The Swinger is the safe option as they both have to run into the first three but one could also look at taking Exactas both ways – 4×5 and 5×4 – and though in this case they will have to run first and second, the rewards will be a lot better. Value Bet: Race 4 No 11 Irish Rain – Eachway It is always dangerous when trainer Cliffie Miller uses jockey Marco van Rensburg. This is the case with Irish Rain who also has the benefit of jumping from No 1 draw. Irish Rain opened at 10-1 but there has already been some money for him and he is now trading at 7-1.
