Since then, things are said to have become very tough for the former South Africa international, who is currently in Mafikeng. “It’s sad to see someone like him roaming around the street collecting garbage, it’s really sad because this is someone we grew up looking up to and he had a very good football career. What happened to him by going to prison was very unfortunate. I think that was the beginning of his downfall because before he was arrested  he was living in a big house and had everything that he wanted. “I just wish someone could offer him some help because he is a really good guy and he knows what he did in the past was wrong and he paid for his mistakes. Everyone deserves a second chance and I believe he deserves it,” said the source.
