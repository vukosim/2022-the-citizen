With diesel power across all of its models now officially a thing of the past, Volvo has introduced a second plug-in hybrid Recharge model to its local line-up, this time based on the stalwart XC90. Joining the all-electric XC40 P8 Recharge and the plugged-in XC60 T8 Recharge unveiled last month, the XC90 Recharge replaces the previous plug-in T8 as the most powerful production Volvo ever made. Available once again in Inscription and R-Design trim levels, the Recharge’s exterior and interior have been carried over with no alterations having additionally taken place on the safety and specification fronts. What has changed though is the powerunit. While the 2.0-litre turbocharged Drive-E petrol engine continues, the lithium-ion battery pack has been increased from 11.6-kWh, to 18.8-kWh and the previous 65 kW electric motor replaced by a new 107 kW unit.
