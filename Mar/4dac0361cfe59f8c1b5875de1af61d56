Classic day at Turffontein on Saturday looks like being a replay of Guineas day of a month ago – certainly in terms of the main acts. Rain In Holland and Safe Passage won the first legs of the Triple Crown and Tiara back then and look mighty likely to stage a repeat performance in the second legs, the SA Classic and Wilgerbosdrift Fillies Classic. The feeling of déjà vu will only be heightened by the fact that the horses run in the same colours – the blue and white of Gaynor Rupert’s Drakenstein Stud. Luckily, the star three-year-olds are trained by two different fellows – though former champions Sean Tarry and Mike de Kock are near neighbours in their barns at Randjesfontein. Tarry’s Rain In Holland scored in style in the 1600m Gauteng Fillies Guineas and, though she has never been the 1800m of this contest, the manner of that win – and her pedigree – suggest she’ll manage it with ease. Richard Fourie returns to keep the Tiara dream alive. Highly rated Desert Miracle was hot favourite for that Fillies Guineas but could not find her best on the day. Even if she does manage to locate it this time, she might be challenged by the extra ground. Fillies Guineas runner up Sprinkles also has a shadow of stamina doubt, but she has been backed in the ante-post market and that sort of move must always be respected. De Kock said after the Guineas that Safe Passage was ideally suited to 1800m, and further. None of the several re-opposing horses look like having that capability – or the capacity to up their games significantly enough to lay a glove on the son of Silvano. One very interesting Classic runner is Fabian Habib-trained Zeus, who is unbeaten in four at a much lower level and comes into this Grade 1 test possibly under-rated by the handicappers. He’s a “could be anything” package and nervous punters might want to include him in their permutations. A bumper day’s entertainment is in store, with 11 races, including the Grade 2 Hawaii Stakes, carded and a predicted Pick 6 pool of R5 million.
