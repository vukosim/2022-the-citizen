If you’re in the mood for something other than a stew or lasagne, this savoury mince-filled gem squash recipe could become your new favourite.  Plus, it’s the perfect comfort meal for a cold and rainy evening.  Instead of serving your gem squash as a side dish with a protein, make an entire meal out of the gem squash by adding a savoury mince filling with white sauce and cheddar cheese to it. If you are trying to eat less meat, you can substitute the mince with a canned sweetcorn filling and a sprinkling of cheese on the top.
