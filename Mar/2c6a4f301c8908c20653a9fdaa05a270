With the wet weather conditions, Johannesburg Emergency Services (JMS) urged motorists and residents to take extra precautions during adverse weather conditions. Spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi said all emergency services will be on standby for any incident. “It’s raining in most parts of the city of Johannesburg, most roads are wet and slippery. We just want to urge all our motorists to exercise caution while driving, extend a safe following distance and also try and avoid crossing bridges which may have flooded overnight.” Mulaudzi also urged residents, especially those in informal settlements and low-lying areas to take extra precautions. “Our residents in our low-lying areas must monitor the water level in those areas and also avoid crossing manmade bridges and be on the lookout for pedestrians. “From our side as the city of Johannesburg emergency services, we will remain on high alert monitoring all regions of the city to make sure we respond to any water-related emergencies which may occur”.
