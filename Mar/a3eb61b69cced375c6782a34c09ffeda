The Paul Peter-Warren Kennedy team look likely to dominate Thursday’s Vaal Classic meeting. The trainer and jockey partner up with five horses and all are at the top of the ante-post betting boards. A few visits to the winner’s circle could get underway in Race 4, a Maiden Plate over 1000m, the only starting gate on the Classic course that’s not on the turn. Maradiva is tackling his second race after being gelded and should improve on the sixth place he managed soon after suffering the unkindest cut. Before the op, he had posted a couple of seconds and it seemed his first win was not far off. Anything like those efforts, without the encumbrance of danglies, should see Maradiva prevail. Race 5 is another 1000m dash, but this time a MR96 affair with rather superior sprinters. One of those is Mufasa, who still has his family jewels, thanks to two wins and a clutch of places. Indeed, he has never been out of the money for Peter and the owners, the Werners, so no call for the knife as yet. Kennedy has also profited from Mufasa’s exemplary behaviour and should do so again. Imposing Angel in Race 7, an MR66 Handicap over 1000m, is a filly, so doesn’t have the Scalpel of Damocles hanging over her. She, too, has a brace of wins on her record and should post another here. Four-year-old Naval Guard lost his goolies during an extended break from racing last year and showed the benefits by bouncing back with an impressive maiden win on New Year’s Day. The follow-up a fortnight later saw him a bit dopey and slow at the start, but he got his head together to run on well into fourth. On Thursday, he goes over a similar distance in Race 9 and will be the horse to beat on his third outing after the break and the snip.
