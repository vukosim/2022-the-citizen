The body of a woman who was cut in half was discovered in a toilet in Maclear, Eastern Cape, and a man in his mid-50s has been arrested in connection with murder of the 27-year-old victim. The victim, Bongeka Madini was found in a toilet in TV Park, after she was allegedly raped before being murdered. According to reports, the 55-year-old man used a saw to dismember Madini’s body. It was reported that she had been out with a friend at a tavern on Friday, 25 February, and the 55-year-old suspect was seen drinking with them.
