The Newlands Forest Park in Table Mountain, Cape Town, is experiencing a new type of vandalism on endangered tees.  The park has noticed a sudden spike in the number of trees being vandalised since early February. This comes after they noticed an alarming amount of bark stripping last year, which Lauren Clayton, the spokesperson of the park, said is an issue that still persists. The trees are being vandalised by people carving their names into the bark. To make the matter worse, the trees that are being vandalised are endangered. When trees are vandalised, it curbs the benefits they provide and increases the cost of planting programmes, according to a research conducted by Emma Richardson and Charlie Shackleton. “The trees that are targeted for this vandalism are endangered trees,” said Clayton. She said there hasn’t been a specific species targeted with the carving, unlike what is seen with bark stripping on the Cape Beech (Boekenhout) trees. “This kind of vandalism on these endangered trees in the Newlands Forest is new to us,” said Clayton. The park uses organic tree sealer to help the tree, but said that it does not mean the carving will disappear. Clayton explained that the park forbids carving as it also destroys the beauty of the trees. According to the park’s research, residents blamed boredom, misbehaviour, lack of appreciation and collection of wood as the main reasons of tree vandalism.  Suggestions by residents to prevent vandalism included planting in sensible areas, re-designing the protective structures, and promoting community participation and ownership in tree planting. Clayton said a fine of up to R1,000 can be issued if one is found intentionally disturbing any tree in Newlands Forest Park. “We appeal to members of the public to report this kind of activity on the emergency number 086 110 6417.”   You can also send an email to Mathabatha.matjila@sanparks.org with GPS location and pictures.
