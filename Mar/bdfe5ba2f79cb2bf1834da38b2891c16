Bangladesh on Friday named South African fast bowling great Allan Donald as the new pace bowling coach of the national side, the country’s cricket board said. “Allan will join us as bowling coach and will work with the national side until Twenty20 World Cup in Australia this year,” the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s cricket operation chief Jalal Yunus told AFP. Donald is replacing West Indies’ Ottis Gibson, who left Bangladesh in January after working with the side for two years.
