Many teams coming to Loftus Versfeld these days try to ignore the effects of altitude, but one factor the Bulls are hoping Munster are not able to brush aside in their United Rugby Championship clash in Pretoria on Saturday is the late afternoon heat of a summer’s day. Kick-off on Saturday is at 4.05pm and, judging by the weather forecast for Pretoria this week, the temperature could still be a warm 28°, a far cry from the 7° Munster was shivering in on Monday.

We hope we can chase them around the field with the sun beaming down. “We want to make them tired and then hopefully the game will open up a bit later on. But it’s going to be a good challenge for us, to measure ourselves against top players in the URC.” ALSO READ: Lions must turn things around to save face in URC The 27-year-old Smith is a key figure in the Bulls side at present, with Morne Steyn suspended and Johan Goosen out injured, and he has enjoyed very good outings against both Zebre in Parma and Griquas in Kimberley. “I’ve definitely felt the pressure because I’ve mostly played off the bench for the last two years. I have not played many full 80s,” Smith said, “but I see it more as an opportunity. “It’s more the pressure I’m putting on myself to make use of this opportunity than any external pressure. “I’ve been working on playing more flat and being more in the defence’s faces. I do tend to hang back a bit. I sometimes rely more on my passing game than my running game.”
