Universities South Africa (USAf) organisation says that it is open to engagements with education stakeholders to assist students returning from war-torn Ukraine get placements in local universities. CEO of USAf Professor Ahmed Bawa told news broadcaster NewzroomAfrika that if possibilities of assisting students with placements existed, they would have to be explored despite that higher education institutions have just completed their intake for the year. “Universities have just gone through the process of filling in spaces and this year there were about 210,000 places that were available for first-year students… and students who were already in the system,” said Bawa. “We have no idea really what kind of programmes the students in Ukraine are studying and how that will match what is available here.

The overall pass rate of the matric class of 2021 recorded 76.4%, improving by 0.2%. A total of 256,031 pupils got bachelors, an increase from the previous year.
