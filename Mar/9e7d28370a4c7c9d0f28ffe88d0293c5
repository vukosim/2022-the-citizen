I am 45. My only debt is an outstanding bond of R1.6 million. I have R10 000 available per month. Do I keep on paying [this extra money] into my bond to clear it or should I do something else with the available funds? It is great that you have a healthy amount available as a monthly free reserve. It is an age-old debate: Must I first clear all my debt and pay my bond as soon as possible, or must I invest? My answer is simple: it depends …. In order to come to a more definite conclusion, one must take your overall current financial position into consideration. Do you currently have investments, and if yes, how much? Do you contribute towards retirement funding, and if yes, how much? Do you have access to emergency funds? Is there something special that you would like to purchase or do in the next five to 10 years? Without the above information, I would like to make some comments, some of which some people may find controversial: I hope this helped. NOW READ: South Africa’s millionaires grew by 14% since 2020
