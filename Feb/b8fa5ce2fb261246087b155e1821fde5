The victim was only three years old when the incident occurred. The testimony of the woman’s nine-year-old son made justice prevail as it led to the prosecution of their mother. The woman was sentenced to three years on 1 count of rape, three years on count 2 (section 22), three years on count 3 (section 7) and eight years for attempted murder. Her sentences were suspended for five years. all the other charges will run concurrently with the 18-year sentence.
