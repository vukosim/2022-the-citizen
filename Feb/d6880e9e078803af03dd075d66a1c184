Having announced pricing for the updated XC60 range earlier this month, Volvo has now confirmed availability of the plug-in hybrid Recharge derivative. Officially the firm’s third plugged-in model after the XC90 T8 and the all-electric XC40 P8 Recharge, the XC60 Recharge arrives with little to distinguish itself from its mild-hybrid sibling, bar the inclusion of a secondary flap on the front wing that hides the charging port. Available in R-Design and Inscription trim levels, the XC60 Recharge combines the familiar 2.0 Drive-E turbo-and-supercharged petrol engine with a rear axle mounted 18.8-kWh battery that drives a 107 kW electric motor for a combined system output of 228 kW. Paired to the equally acquainted eight-speed Geartronic gearbox with drive going to all four wheels, the XC60 Recharge will sprint from 0-100 km/h in 4.8 seconds and top out at 180 km/h. The claimed all-electric range is 81 km.
