Reigning champion trainer Justin Snaith has been collecting plenty of big-race prizes lately, which has seen him leap to the top of the 2022 championship log – vaulting Joburg-based Paul Peter, who led the standings for several months. Before racing on Wednesday, Snaith had amassed R11,341,213 in prize money, while Peter had a haul of R10,129,813. In third and fourth places were former champs Sean Tarry and Mike de Kock, with R6.25 million and R6.1 million respectively. Then came Gavin Smith and Candice Bass-Robinson with just under R5 million each. With the Cape season winding down and the Highveld big-money autumn action revving up, things could get very tight at the top – before the big annual showdown in the KwaZulu-Natal winter. Peter heads to Turffontein on Thursday with a strong hand and looks likely to start chipping away at Snaith’s lead with at least a couple of likely winners. One of the more interesting Peter runners is Lamborghreeni in Race 5, a Maiden Plate over 2600m. This guy got a go as a reserve runner at Turffontein on Saturday – and a first run for him at that – and surprised everyone with a battling third place over the city track’s daunting 2000m. Being pitched in over this 600m extra strongly suggests Peter knows he’s dealing with a true marathoner, though there is speed on the gelding’s dam side. If Lamborghreeni confirms this impression and shows natural improvement, he’ll give likely favourite Cape Bouquet something to think about.
