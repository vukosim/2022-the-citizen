Joburg’s first marathon of 2022, the Joburg North City Marathon hosted by Run Zone Athletics Club, is now just over a week away. The Joburg North City Marathon, of which The Citizen is an associate sponsor, will be held on Sunday 13 February. The event will allow road runners to compete in a 5km fun run or 10km and 21.1km events and the full marathon of 42.2km. The marathon will serve as a Two Oceans and Comrades qualifier. “This will be the third staging of the JNCM, but the first live event,” explained Run Zone chairman Graham Block. The marathon was due to be staged the first time in 2020, but a week before the scheduled race, the government shut down the country with the first lockdown, following the outbreak of Covid on the world. “That was hugely disappointing for us,” said Block. “Everything was in place for the event to take place, but then Covid hit. “We had to make a plan and staged a virtual event months later. We did the same last year, in 2021. “This time, we are pleased and excited that the real live event will happen in the streets and suburbs of Joburg. The different race distances on the day will all follow the original routes, starting and finishing at Marks Park.” All participants will receive medals after their event, while T-shirts and buffs are also available for purchase. Entries can be done online or on race day. “We’re really happy to be back on the road, running in real events again,” said Block. “It should be a great day out for runners and making it even bigger and better is the fact the marathon is a Two Oceans and Comrades qualifier.” For entry details and information, please visit joburgnorthcitymarathon.co.za.
