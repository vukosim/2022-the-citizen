With the side having lost out on making history by claiming their first cup title when they lost in the final of the Nedbank Cup last year, Chippa United coach Kurt Lentjies wants to do better this time around.ALSO READ: Nedbank Cup bitter-sweet for Chiefs’ Bvuma But at the same time he doesn’t want to put too much pressure on his players. The Chilli Boys begin their Ke Yona journey away against University of Pretoria – a side Lentjies knows always puts up a fight. Lentjies was a player when Chippa lost to Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila in the final last year.   “AmaTuks have been in the Premier League before, but they have campaigned in the first division in the past few years – they are always a dangerous team to play,” said Lentjies.  “But it is more about us because after this long break, we came back on January 10th and I am sure the players are itching to get back onto the field.  “They are obviously excited… I think we are well prepared but it is difficult to gauge where we will be and we will see once the game starts where we need to do to win the match.  Asked about the omen of lower division sides being proving to be difficult for top-tier sides in this competition, Lentjies said: “For us, it’s just another football match that we want to win and go to the next round – we want to win every match we play – it doesn’t matter who we play against.  “Inasmuch as we finished as runners-up last season, that’s something I want to put into the players that we should go all the way because people remember the winners not who got knocked out in the first round or in the finals. It’s a new clean slate and we will take it one game at a time.” The game will be played at Tuks Stadium this afternoon.
