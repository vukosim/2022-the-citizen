AmaZulu FC fought gallantly in their opening Caf Champions League Group B game but all their efforts were worthless as they ended up with a 1-0 loss to Moroccan giants Raja Casablanca.  READ ALSO: Baxter explains Ngcobo’s absence in Chiefs’ dull draw with City  And while the game was difficult, Usuthu had some moments where they could have created chances for themselves and turned it in their favour. But not all is lost, and according to the team’s Zambian attacker Augustine Mulenga, they may have burnt their fingers and learnt their lesson. “What we have learnt from that game is that when you have an away game you will not have a lot of chances to score. If you get one or two you have to use them because away games are always difficult,” says Mulenga.  “The referees will also not be on your side. But if you use your chances you might even collect maximum points. You just have to be disciplined and not make a lot of mistakes.”  Usuthu are now looking to make amends at home when they host Guinea giants Horoya AC at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Friday.  “Today (Wednesday) we had our first training session and everyone is looking forward to Friday’s game and since everyone knows that home games are important I am sure they will put up a fight so we can collect maximum points,” says Mulenga.
