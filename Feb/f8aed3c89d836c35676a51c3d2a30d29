Richard Mbulu came to the rescue of Baroka FC, netting a stoppage time rocket in a DStv Premiership tie against Mamelodi Sundowns on Monday night as Bakgaga held the runaway league leaders to a 1-1 draw at the old Peter Mokaba Stadium.

Before that, it was the Lyle Lakay show, and if you’re looking for a specialist free kick taker in the Premier Soccer League, look no further than the Mamelodi Sundowns magician, who could’ve easily walked away with a hat trick. Lakay stood over three freekicks, struck the woodwork twice and converted one to earn himself the Man-of-the-Match award. Have you ever heard of the age-old saying, ‘don’t count your chickens before they hatch?’ Well, Kgoloko Thobejane and his Baroka side were struck by those words last night when they clenched their fists, punched the air and jumped for joy as referee Xola Sitela awarded them a penalty in the 23rd minute. Rushine De Reuck was the culprit who conceded the penalty but it was all sparked by Evidence Makgopa, who turned his marker inside out before unleashing a shot at Denis Onyango, who parried into the path of Ntiyiso Bombi. Mbombi then tried to play the ball back into the goal mouth where De Reuck handled the ball in his attempt to extinguish the danger. However, Baroka defender Basil Mphahlele disappointed everyone affiliated to Bakgaga as he ballooned his effort way over the bar, much to the relief of Masandawana. It looked like Baroka would pay the ultimate price for that miss, but in the end, Mbulu earned them a point.
