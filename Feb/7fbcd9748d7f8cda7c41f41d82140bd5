A fire started by an arsonist broke out overnight at the cathedral where Archbishop Desmond Tutu is buried, a church leader announced on Sunday. The fire was detected in the basement of a section of St. George’s Cathedral in Cape Town at around 2am. “The fire was an act of arson,” father Michael Weeder, dean at the cathedral, said in an note to his parish. “It appears that a lit piece of cotton/gauze was thrown through the small, barred window near the steps leading up to the cathedral’s (main)… entrance,” he said. “Someone was spotted running away from the cathedral.” ALSO READ: Carnival City evacuated after fire breaks out at casino Firefighters quickly put out the fire, and other than “traces of smoke… there was no discernable damage done,” he added.
