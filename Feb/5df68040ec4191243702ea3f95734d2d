VAAL BEST BET Race 4 Swinger 2-Run As One and 10 Cheringoma This is not the easiest of cards but these two are well weighted in this Middle Stakes race over 2000m. Cheringoma is the runner to beat but this filly, owned by HSH Princess Charlene of Monaco, tries 2000m for the first time. On breeding it should not be a problem. Run As One has excellent form over the distance. VALUE BET Race 7 No 17 Rose Willow – Eachway Brett Webber’s filly ran third behind Cheringoma last time in a stronger race than this and will benefit from the drop to 1400m from 1600m. She is drawn on the outside which is favourable on this straight track and looks excellent value at 8-1. Also, take a Swinger with No 2 Sound Of Hounds, who is unbeaten in two starts.
