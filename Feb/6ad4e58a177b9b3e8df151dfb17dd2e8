Document management is how your company manages, stores, and tracks electronic documents.  Document Management imposes controls and management capabilities onto documents, so when you need to use said documents, you can do so. Document management systems range from small systems to large-scale configurations serving an international audience. Document management systems provide a means to incorporate standard physical document filing practices electronically. The Document Warehouse (TDW) recognises the importance of this practice, which is why we use advanced electronic document management software (EDMS) to provide effective document management solutions.  EDMS technology manages data capturing, document scanning, and records retrieval.
