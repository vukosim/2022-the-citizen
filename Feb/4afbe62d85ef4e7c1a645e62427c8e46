Dewald Brevis may be just 18 years old and was playing only his second senior T20 match, but he showed he is one of the cool cats when it comes to finishing an innings as he steered the Northerns Titans to a seven-wicket win with 15 balls remaining against the KZN Dolphins in the CSA T20 Challenge at St George’s Park on Monday. Northerns were chasing 135 in 19 overs to win, and although Theunis de Bruyn (24) and Quinton de Kock (26) made a solid start by adding 53 off 43 balls, they were both dismissed in the space of two overs, leaving the Titans with 71 to win off 61 deliveries. Brevis, who Mumbai Indians paid R6 million for in the IPL auction at the weekend, began cautiously, but then opened up in the latter stages as he stroked an impressive 46 not out off 30 balls, with four fours and two sixes. Sibonelo Makhanya helped add the finishing touches to the innings with a busy 21 not out off just 11 deliveries. Thando Ntini was the best of the KZN bowlers with 2/21 in four overs. Northerns had earlier won an important toss after morning rain had delayed the start of play, sending KZN in and reducing them to 28/3 as their seamers proved too testing for the Dolphins top-order. But David Miller, the country’s premier finisher, lashed 57 not out off 40 balls and was helped in turning the innings around by Jason Smith (38). While the Northerns pacemen – Lizaad Williams (4-0-29-1), Junior Dala (4-0-27-2) and Aya Gqamane (1-0-3-1) – prospered, left-arm spinner Aaron Phangiso was also outstanding, conceding just 19 runs in four overs. In Monday’s other game, Wihan Lubbe (24 off 21) and Lesiba Ngoepe (27 off 21) ensured there was an advantageous platform laid for the Eastern Province Warriors, but Tristan Stubbs once again stole the show with a brilliant, fiery 65 off just 35 balls, taking them to a daunting 170/5. But the Free State Knights’ opening pair of debutant Christoffel Klijnhans and Jacques Snyman then stole Stubbs’ thunder as they added a massive 156 in 17 overs to set up a nine-wicket win with eight balls to spare, their first in the competition. While Snyman, who also took 2/23 in three overs with his part-time off-spin, was dismissed for a match-winning 90 off just 52 deliveries, Klijnhans batted through to score an impressive 67 not out off 54 balls.
