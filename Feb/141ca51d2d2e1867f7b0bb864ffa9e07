With three of Kaizer Chiefs’ goalkeepers having spent some time away from the team during the January break, Itumeleng Khune has emerged as a possible starter for Amakhosi’s Nedbank Cup fixture against TS Galaxy.ALSO READ: Khune: I will retire after 10 yearsOf the four Amakhosi keepers, Brandon Peterson was the only one who joined the team for their training camp in Cape Town last week. Khune, Daniel Akpeyi and Bruce Bvuma were all away.Akpeyi was with the Nigeria national team for the Caf Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, where he didn’t get any game time.Khune and Bvuma were with the Warriors in the DStv Compact Cup which was played over the past two weeksKhune played both games from start to finish for the Gauteng side and showed that he is still a classy keeper.Although he conceded in both games, Khune was in his element with some acrobatic saves to help the Warriors win the inaugural competition after a 2-1 win over Coastal United in the final on Saturday.With his appetite for the game back after tasting some game time for the first time in a while, Khune will probably fight even harder for his place in Stuart Baxter’s team.He has revealed that he works extra hard to keep fit and in good shape.“I’m not out here to prove any point to anyone that I’ve still got it,” said Khune of his involvement in the Compact Cup.“But just to enjoy myself and give the fans who still believe in me and have voted for me something to smile about.“I do a lot of extra work after-hours at home. Because obviously, my body is my investment. When I invest in my body, it can take me until I am 40-plus,” added the 34-year-old.Khune has played just one game for Amakhosi so far this season, when he manned the poles in their MTN 8 quarterfinal against Mamelodi Sundowns, where they lost on penalties in August.Since then he has not even made the squad, with Akpeyi the preferred No 1 and Peterson or Bvuma making the bench.
