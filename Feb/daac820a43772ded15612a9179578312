Matlaba, whom Phakaaathi reported on Monday morning that he had filed for a termination at Swallows FC, is the most experienced of the four.  The other three are from TS Galaxy and were part of the team there and their release is still astounding as the Mpumalanga side are struggling.   Phakaaathi have also meanwhile learnt that there will be further changes in the team in the upcoming weeks especially in the technical team.  Royal AM have already parted ways with assistant coach Ditheko Mototo and goalkeeper coach Simon Gopane. Insiders have revealed that a new technical team is being deliberated upon.  “There will be big changes and the format of their technical team will be a first of its kind in this country,” said a source.  “They will be introducing Ruud Krol as head of technical in the near future while they are also considering getting position specific coaches for defence and attack,” added the source.  The Pietermaritzburg-based side also parted with a few players including Siphelele Luthuli and Ronald Pfambuzai who have since joined Chippa United and Sera Motebang who was unveiled by Golden Arrows as their player on Tuesday.
