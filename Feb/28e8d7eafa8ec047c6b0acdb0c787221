VAAL CLASSIC Best Bet: Race 7: Cheringoma (7) to win. This Flower Alley filly ran out a 4-length winner last time out to exit the maidens with blinkers fitted. The headgear is retained. Value Bet: Race 5: Eachway on Apollo Robbins (7) Probably the most competitive field of the day. Apollo Robbins is second from bottom on the bookmakers’ boards at 10-1, while Raiseahallelujah is second from the top at 33-10. These two met on 18 Nov last year, when Raiseahallelujah was the victor by 6 lengths. However, this time round there is a 11,5kg swing in weights in favour of Apollo Robbins. Fabian Habib’s runner is also at his best second time out after a rest.
