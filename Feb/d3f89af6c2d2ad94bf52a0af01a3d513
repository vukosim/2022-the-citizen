Stalwart prop Brok Harris is set to make his 100th appearance for the Stormers when they take on the Sharks in their United Rugby Championship clash at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. The 36-year-old made his debut for the Stormers in 2007, playing 93 times for them before leaving for Wales in 2014, where he spent seven years and made 133 appearances for the Dragons before leaving last year. He was then brought back into the Stormers fold just before the start of the URC to help out a largely inexperienced front-row contingent.

After leaving seven years ago I never thought in my wildest dreams I would get the opportunity to get the 100 because I was seven short,” admitted Harris. “So when I got the opportunity to return it was a no-brainer, and I just got back in, tried to contribute and get to that 100, and now it’s here, so I am really happy. “It’s been amazing, starting as a youngster in 2007 and now all of a sudden being the oldest. It has happened so quickly, but it’s been a hell of a journey. “I have had some great memories playing with some legends of the game and now getting the chance to watch the young talent coming through is a great experience for me to work with as well.” ALSO READ: ‘I thought we were buried’: Dobson praises resilient Stormers Stormers coach John Dobson was also thrilled to see Harris reach the impressive milestone and was full of praise for his massive influence on the staff and fellow players since rejoining the union. “Our coaches hadn’t coached Brok before, and although it has only been a small percent out of his career, for us it has been a real privilege,” said Dobson. “What he has brought to the group as a player, as a coach and as a person has been special and we are really lucky to share this experience with him.”
