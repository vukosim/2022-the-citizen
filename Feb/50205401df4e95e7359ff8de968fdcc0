His name is Mogamat May. He is a young and promising player, 23 years of age,” said Tinkler as the club announced their latest addition to their arsenal.  “He was playing for Hanover Park and was having a great season, scoring 12 goals in nine games which is quite prolific.  “He came to us on trial and he did exactly what he was doing at Hanover Park, scoring lots of goals at training and in friendly games that we played.  “That obviously generated interest and it was a no-brainer for us to sign him. He is a natural goal scorer from what I have seen and I believe. He has a lot of pace and power. I think he is a good acquisition for us in the striking department,” added the former Orlando Pirates mentor.  May will have to fight for his position with new striker from Venezuela Darwin Gonzalez. Gonzalez was also unveiled on Tuesday as City’s new hope for goals. This was a day after the Citizens had announced the departure of Fagrie Lakay who joined Egyptian side Pyramids FC.
