Whether you’re looking for a special gift for her, him, you both, your mom, someone who’s a dog lover or whoever else, a little something from Demi-Leigh Tebow and her husband Tim’s jewellery range, ONE FIVE THREE by Demi and Tim might be the one piece of bling you can’t leave out of the Valentine’s gift box this year – even if it’s a little late. “Our @153jewelry Valentine’s Day collection is here,” Demi-Leigh exclaimed on her Insta-feed. Her wish for the buyer: That the beautiful jewellery pieces will serve as a reminder that God’s love and faithfulness is never going to be absent. She also quoted Proverbs 3:3-4 in her post: “Let love and faithfulness never leave you. Bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.” READ: Demi-Leigh Tebow and husband building home for abandoned babies in Joburg Demi and Tim dropped three new styles just in time for Valentine’s Day, including dainty personalised necklaces – the perfect gift to prove your love. They also have a pink sapphire heart necklace and their men’s cross pendants seem to do pretty well too. Tim Tebow shared a reel about the collection on his feed, saying: “I think to be able to give a gift that has meaning and purpose is so special. To be able to give Demi something that is nice and shows her how much I love her and also might remind her how much God loves her, it’s like a double whammy.” The celebrity couple launched ONE FIVE THREE by Demi and Tim in July 2021, saying that it’s a line for believers everywhere. They chose the name ‘153’ because each number has special meaning. 1 Signifies that Jesus died one time for us on the cross, 5 is the number for grace, and 3 signifies the Holy Trinity. The number is also special to Demi-Leigh and Tim in that it incorporates one of their favourite Bible verses, John 15:13, which says: “Greater love has no one than this; to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”
