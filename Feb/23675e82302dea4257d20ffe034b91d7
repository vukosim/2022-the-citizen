Revealed back in 2018, the current third generation BMW Z4 will reportedly be the last if a report from Spain is to be believed. According to motors:es, slowing sales compared to its main rival, the Porsche Boxster, has been cited as the apparent reason for Munich wanting to end production by 2025, the same year in which Toyota will allegedly halt sales of the mechanically identical Supra. The online publication further reports that the Z4 will receive a mid-life facelift next year, which will also be its first and only before being phased-out. ALSO READ: New BMW Z4 is more than just fast Reportedly, BMW has ruled a switch to electrification out entirely, meaning the Z4 will soldier on until its demise with the same engine options offered in the Supra; a 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder and the upgraded 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six. Unlike the Supra though, which will spawn an ultra-hardcore GRMN model allegedly next year powered by a more powerful version of the 3.0-litre S58 engine used in the M3/M4 Competition, the Z4 won’t be offer a comparative M model as it was never designed to be topped by any other model bar the flagship M40i. Unaltered since its debut four years ago, the respective updates are likely to consist of BMW’s revised 10.25-inch iDrive infotainment system, the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and possibly upgraded materials and additional features come 2023. For now, little else is known, but expect details to become apparent throughout the year.
