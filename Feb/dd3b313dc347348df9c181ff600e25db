The dates for Proteas coach Mark Boucher to appear before a disciplinary committee hearing have been confirmed, according to Sport24. Boucher, who recently oversaw the Proteasâ€™ Test series and ODI series wins against India, will have to answer to a panel between 16 and 20 May. The national team coach was recently charged with misconduct following allegations that came to light during the Social Justice and Nation-building (SJN) hearings. Advocate Terry Motau will chair the hearings. The Proteas, under Boucher, leave to New Zealand for a two-Test series on Wednesday.  Boucher will also thus be in charge of the national team for the series against Bangladesh in South Africa in March and April, before his hearing. Boucher, who played close to 150 Tests and nearly 300 ODIs for the national team, took charge of the Proteas in late 2019.
