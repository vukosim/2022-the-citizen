Former Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brighton Mhlongo is looking to brighten his life beyond the goal posts. Mhlongo was forced into early retirement after a freak training ground accident left him partially blind and unable to continue with football.

A source has revealed that Mhlongo is now venturing into business as he starts his life away from the game he loves. “He is going about it quietly and wants to do things the right way. He has spent the past few months speaking to various business people seeking advice. He was in Durban to meet some other people at the weekend as he wants to gather as much information before he decides on the kind of business he goes into,” said the source.  Mhlongo started his career at Pirates as a teen but couldn’t command a regular berth when he eventually graduated to the senior team. He was seen as a capable replacement when Senzo Meyiwa died unexpectedly a few years ago but the shoes proved too big for him to fill. He was later transferred to Chippa United but he didn’t have a good stay there either and joined Bidvest Wits before they were sold to Tshakhuma.
