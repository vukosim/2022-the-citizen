Russia is a member of Swift and according to Zoltan Pozsar, strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG, the decision to exclude various Russian lenders from this important financial messaging system could lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts in the international banking system, as well as encourage monetary authorities to reactivate daily operations to supply the market with dollars. “Exclusions from Swift will lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts similar to the missed payments and giant overdrafts that we saw in March 2020,” Pozsar wrote in a note. “Current excess reserves and reverse repurchase agreement facilities will not be enough and monetary authorities will need to act.” According to the Russian National Swift Association, Rosswift, Russia is the second-largest country after the United States regarding number of users and about 300 Russian financial institutions, more than half in the country, are members. If Russian banks are removed from Swift, they will be unable to make or receive payments with or from foreign financial institutions in trade transactions.
