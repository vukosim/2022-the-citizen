The Cape Town visitors rather successfully plundered last Friday’s Fairview feature race meeting, but one let-down was the disappointing showing of Captain Tatters in the Merchants. Backed in to 3-1, Justin Snaith’s five-year-old sprinter was jittery in the pre-race proceedings and performed as if he’d used up his store of nervous energy – finishing fifth behind fellow Cape Town raider Spring Awakening (5-1) from the Andre Nel stable. Snaith has Captain Tatters back to face the same track and trip, just seven days later, and you’d expect the horse to be a bit more settled in a familiar place this time. He will start at shortish odds for Race 5, a 1200m Graduation Plate, in far more modest company than last week and is the best option for an exotics-bets banker. Richard Fourie reprises his role in the irons and will also have a better feel for the horse and his response to his surroundings. Fourie also partners Snaith’s other two runners on the day, Wildest Dreams in Race 2 and What A Blizzard in the eighth and last. Both must be included in all bets.
