Orlando Pirates co-coach Fadlu Davids has admitted that playing AmaZulu FC in the last 32-round of the Nedbank Cup will be a tough challenge for the Buccaneers.

Pirates and AmaZulu have already met twice this season in the DStv Premiership campaign, with the first encounter ending in a 1-1 draw, while Bucs got the better of the KwaZulu-Natal club in the second meeting, beating them 2-1. “Preparations have gone well, considering that we had disruptions in terms of players falling ill, plus some being away in the DStv Compact Cup. Luckily, now in the final week before our first game back, it will be the first time that we’ll have at least 95% of our squad back training together. So that is a big positive,” said Davids. “A cup game is different from a league game. AmaZulu were a bit more conservative in the league games. They managed to get a draw on their home ground. We expect them to fix their mistakes and come out guns blazing against us, knowing that we beat them in the last game of last year. It’s going to be a very different encounter with it being a cup game, and the two teams will look at this tournament as their chance to finish the season with silverware.” The Nedbank Cup is a chance for Bucs to lift their second trophy in two seasons after winning the MTN8 last campaign, but Usuthu, who have looked to be rejuvenated since the arrival of Benni McCarthy as head coach are also itching for some silverware.
