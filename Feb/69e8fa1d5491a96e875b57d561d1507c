TS Galaxy ladies coach Mpumelelo Ngomane says they are eager to win the Sasol National League Championships, but he won’t put his team under pressure during the tournament to be staged in Durban from 7 February until 13 February.

Ngomane admits that Sukazi coming on board has really helped the team, which is why it is important for them to make it to the elite women’s league in the country, the Hollywoodbets Super League, but says he won’t put his charges under pressure. “It is important for us to get promoted. But I think it’s a target for any team that plays in the league. We, as TS Galaxy, have a huge responsibility because our male team plays in the DStv Premiership and everyone expects us to be promoted to the Hollywoodbets Super League because of that,” said the Galaxy ladies coach.  “But we are not really putting ourselves under pressure, for us. We need to be clinical and play our normal football, if we win, we win, if we lose, we lose. But, this is not the first time we find ourselves in the play-offs, we have been here three times before. The team looks normal, we will just be missing players who have to go school, so they won’t be going with us to Durban. But we still have a strong squad and we know that at this stage, there is something big ahead of us and we want it.” The tournament will see nine Sasol league provincial winners go up against each other for the national trophy that goes with a R200 000 prize money as well as the promotion to the Hollywoodbets Super League to be earned by the finalists.
