Toyota last week announced a brand new motorsport series to be competed in by members of the motoring media, the GR Cup Yaris Challenge. The Citizen road test editor Mark Jones will battle it out against five other motoring journalists on various racetracks around the country, all piloting the Toyota GR Yaris. The other contestants are Jeanette Kok-Kritzinger, Thomas Falkiner, Lerato Matebese, Sean Nurse and Ashley Oldfield. Jones, who competes in the M Performance BMW Car Club Challenge, is excited to fly The Citizen’s flag in the seven-race series. “We are getting to play on a national level and in the process get to drive a really fun car. The GR Yaris is probable one of the most fun cars launched in 2021,” said Jones.
