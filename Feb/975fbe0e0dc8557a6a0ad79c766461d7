New Zealand captain Kane Williamson will miss the upcoming Test series against South Africa after failing to recover from an elbow injury, Black Caps coach Gary Stead said Tuesday. Stead named Tom Latham as stand-in skipper in a 15-man squad that features two debutants in wicketkeeper Cam Fletcher and paceman Blair Tickner. Batter Hamish Rutherford was also recalled after seven years in the Test wilderness, while all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme returns after shaking off a recent form slump.

Seamer Trent Boult will also miss the first Test, starting in Christchurch on February 17, as he awaits the birth of his third child.
