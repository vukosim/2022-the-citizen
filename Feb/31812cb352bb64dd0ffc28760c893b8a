KENILWORTH  BEST BET RACE 2 NO 3 BODY ELECTRIC – WIN This Candice Bass-Robinson-trained filly romped to victory on debut and the word from the connections is that this filly is top class and has a big future. She makes her feature-race debut this time and if as good as they say, she will chalk up another easy victory. VALUE BET RACE 9 NO 6 BOWLED OVER – EACHWAY Trainer Adam Marcus has a high opinion of this three-year-old gelding. He has only run once and did well to finish just 3.60 lengths behind the winner. Marcus has said he is expecting improvement in this race which sees the jockeys take on the work riders. Greg Cheyne is aboard this son of Twice Over and Marcus is convinced his charge is a definite contender in this line-up. He is on offer at 10-1 and looks excellent eachway value.
