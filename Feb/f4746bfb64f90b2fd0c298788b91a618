Photographer Gillian Leigh Soames has also been sharing some sneaky snaps and videos she took of the actor’s arrival on her Instagram page. From the posts she has been sharing it seems that Cruise arrived in Hoedspruit about four days ago to film some of the scenes for the eighth instalment of the Mission: Impossible movie series. Cruise was also spotted in KwaZulu-Natal late last week, reportedly flying his own helicopter over Oribi Gorge scouting for locations for the film. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the film will once again see Cruise reprising the role of agent Ethan Hunt.  The release date for Mission Impossible 7 has been postponed to 14 July 2023 while the release date for Mission Impossible 8 has been pushed from 7 July 2023 to 28 June 2024.
