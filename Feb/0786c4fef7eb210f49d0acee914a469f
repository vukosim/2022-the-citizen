The news came as a shock to the parents as their daughter was never sick.  An autopsy report apparently confirmed that a grape was found lodged in her throat, which had caused her to choke to death. A teacher at the school told the parents that their daughter vomited during lunch. The grape was reportedly among other items packed in her lunch box. The parents are now demanding answers from the school about why they were not immediately called when the incident occurred.  They also want to know why their daughter was not taken to the sick bay or why the school did not administer first aid when they saw her gasping for air.    Amkelekile’s parents have opened a case at the Germiston police and they are hoping to get answers from a police inquest.
