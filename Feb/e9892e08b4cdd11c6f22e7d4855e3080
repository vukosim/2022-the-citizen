Flyhalf Tim Swiel will captain Western Province in their Currie Cup encounter with the Sharks in Durban on Wednesday. Following a week’s break, Western Province play their first away match of the campaign at 8pm. Swiel partners with experienced scrumhalf Godlen Masimla, with Mnombo Zwelendaba starting at outside centre, while there is an all-new back three with Sergeal Petersen at fullback and Leolin Zas and Andre Manuel on the wings. Up front the experienced Ali Vermaak comes into the starting front row, while David Meihuizen makes his return from injury in the second row. This means that Simon Miller is back at flank, with Roelof Smit making his first start on the other side of the scrum.
