The Gauteng department of health in Gauteng has advised that the Tembisa hospital is now open to the public after its temporal closure following a fatal shooting incident on Wednesday morning. The hospital was forced to shut down temporarily after a police officer allegedly murdered his nursing assistant girlfriend in the parking lot and turned the gun on himself but survived. The department said that the incident had left “both patients and staff members traumatised”. “Given the tragic incident, Tembisa Hospital had to divert calls to nearby facilities to allow the police to work on the scene of the incident and for the debriefing and counselling of both staff, patients and the deceased colleague’sfamily,” said the department’s Motalatale Modiba.
