VAAL BEST BET RACE 3 NO 9 DEFENDER OF RIGHTS – WIN Stuart Pettigrew’s filly has only run twice for two successive runner-up spots. Both those runs were over 1400m and this time she will go an extra 100m. As she is by Flower Alley, she will be looking for even further down the line but she should be too good for her opposition in this race and should shed her maiden. VALUE BET RACE 7 NO 8 WAYA YIRE – EACHWAY This Mike de Kock-trained filly is an interesting runner as she has not finished far off the winner in all of her starts and has only once run out of the top four. She comes into this race with just 52kg and although she is taking on a strong field, she is one for the Quartets.
