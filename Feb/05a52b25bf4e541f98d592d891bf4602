Up and coming Griquas talent Zander du Plessis showed off his monster boot on Wednesday afternoon, landing a huge penalty from beyond his own 10m line, which put them 41-20 up against the Pumas after 70 minutes on their way to their first win of this season’s Currie Cup. Du Plessis played a massive part in the Griquas’ superb win and was duly named man-of-the-match, slotting eight penalties during the game, the last being his monster effort from about 62m out, however he did miss two conversion attempts. Du Plessis, 21, joins an impressive list of huge kickers from Grey College, with Frans Steyn and Johan Goosen having nailed attempts from over 60m themselves, keeping alive an impressive tradition from one of the country’s powerhouse rugby schools. This was only Du Plessis’ third appearance for the Griquas, having joined them last year after impressing in the Varsity Cup at fullback for UP Tuks. It will be interesting to see if he can join his past Grey College alumni and make his way into the Springbok setup in the future. After the match Du Plessis, who played at inside centre despite having played flyhalf in the first two matches, told SuperSport: “I train on this field, so I know my range and that’s why I had confidence taking that kick. “I enjoyed it (playing 12) very much, I think it’s a lot like 10 where I am also comfortable at playing. I just had to create a bit for the guys on the outside and being a little bit more physical, but enjoying every moment.”
