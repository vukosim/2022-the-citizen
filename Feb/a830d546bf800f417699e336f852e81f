FAIRVIEW TURF BEST BET RACE 1 NO 3 CHERE FOR ME The Strydom family can get punters off to a winning start and build up a kitty for the day with this two-year-old daughter of Coup De Grace. Jacques Strydom, brother of jockey Piere Strydom, trains this filly who has run second in both her starts, and she will be ridden by Jacques son, apprentice Kyle Strydom. He seems to have found the right field for her and with normal improvement she looks ready to win. VALUE BET RACE 5 NO 2 PALO ALTO – EACHWAY This Tara Lange-trained runner has been ultra-consistent, placing in his last few starts, but all of those have been on the Polytrack. His best form, though, is on the turf and he should enjoy the return to that surface today. He is distance suited and has Chase Maujean up.
