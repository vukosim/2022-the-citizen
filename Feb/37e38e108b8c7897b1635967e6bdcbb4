FAIRVIEW POLYTRACK BEST BET RACE 1 NO 2 STAY THE COURSE – WIN This horse was narrowly beaten over the course and distance from a wide draw last time. This time he jumps from No 1 draw and has Aldo Domeyer up. Should get punters off to a winning start. VALUE BET RACE 7 NO 1 QUERARI FERRARI – EACHWAY This mare had some decent form on the Highveld but her two runs in Port Elizabeth were both moderate. However, they were over sprint distances and this will be her first run over 1600m. Although she will be taking on the colts, she gets a 1.5kg apprentice claim and is nicely drawn at No 1. At her opening price of 14-1 she does look a nice eachway bet.
