SCOTTSVILLE BEST BET RACE 2 NO 6 MIA LOA – WIN There is no substitute for experience, especially for juveniles, and that should give Mike Miller’s runner the edge in this field. She had a decent first run, which was at Scottsville and ran fourth, beaten 2.25 lengths.   There are a number of first-timers in the field but there does not seem to be much enthusiasm about their chances from their trainers and as a result, Mia Loa, with a decent run under her belt, should have enough improvement to beat this field. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO  2 WE ALL CHOMIES – EACHWAY Form at Scottsville is always an advantage for horses as many battle to handle the undulating course. We All Chomies has run second in both of his starts and both runs were over this distance. He is quoted at 8-1 and with an inside draw, which is usually beneficial up the straight, he should feature in the finish.
