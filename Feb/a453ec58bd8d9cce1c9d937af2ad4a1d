Welcome home @ricardonascimento03,” read a post on the Royal AM official Instagram account on Thursday. Club president Shauwn Mkhize also confirmed Nascimento’s capture in a video posted on the self-same Instagram account. “Guys, I have another surprise for you,” she said. “I’m trying to make sure that Royal AM is strengthened. I started with the wingers, I went to the strikers and now I’m coming to the core, strengthening my defence. Are you ready for my surprise? Nascimento,” she added as Nascimento appeared wearing the Number 3 jersey.  Nascimento, who joined Sundowns in 2016, was released by the Brazilians to open the space for the new foreign arrival. Sundowns signed Bolivian forward Erwin Saveerda during the January transfer period thereby exhausting their foreign registration quota. During his time with Sundowns, the 35-year-old defender won four Premiership titles, as well as the CAF Champions League and CAF Super Cup. He also won almost all the domestic cup competitions on offer.
