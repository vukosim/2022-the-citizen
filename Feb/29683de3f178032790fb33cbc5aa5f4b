Mhango, who hasnâ€™t really enjoyed much game time at the Buccaneers this season with injuries and ill-discipline costing him a place in the starting line-up, made headlines during the Afcon after scoring three goals for Malawi, which saw him help the team reach the last 16 of the continental tournament, only to be knocked out by Morocco.
