Maritzburg went in front as Friday Samu netted his maiden league goal for the season in first half added time. He may be the one who rattled the back of the net but it was all down to the labour of former Mamelodi Sundowns defender Nicholus Lukhubeni who did well to dribble past his markers, drifting all the way to the byline and released a pass back into the fray, finding Friday on high alert to slotpast Ronwen Williams. It took The Spartans about 10 minutes after the restart for them to find the equalizer and it was Kudakwashe Mahachi who leveled matters for the visitors, but the day belonged to the hosts as they fought back to bag maximum points. Samu turned the provider in the 71st minute, setting up Rowan Human. The Zambian international did well to create some space for himself down the right flank, though his pass to Human was not the best. However, the 21-year-old used his slickness on the ball to beat his markers and fired a stinging shot past Williams, giving Ernst Middendorp’s side their first win in 11 league outings, creating some breathing space in the relegation quagmire where TS Galaxy sit at the foot of the table with 17 points, while Maritzburg have collected 19.
