Beneficiaries whose phones were used to apply for only one SRD grant can also collect their monies from any Pick ‘n Pay or Boxer supermarket.  If a phone was used to apply for more than one grant, it can only be collected from a Post Office.  This does not apply to beneficiaries who chose to receive their grant in a bank account.  The grants are payable until the end of March 2022.   Sapo has since advised, beneficiaries who have not yet received their grants not to worry because payments will be made at their branches until June 2022: “to make sure all outstanding grants are paid”. The dates are posted regularly on the Post Office’s Twitter and Facebook pages. The handle is @PostOfficeSA.
