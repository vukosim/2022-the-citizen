The South African Weather Service (Saws) has issued a yellow level one warning for thunderstorms with heavy downpours in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday. Intense storms are said to start at 2pm and will continue throughout the day. Saws explained this was due to a surface and upper-air trough, which will result in a chance of thunderstorm activity across the Province. According to the weather service, there is a possibility that the expected thunderstorms may become severe.
