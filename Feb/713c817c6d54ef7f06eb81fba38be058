KENILWORTH BEST BET RACE 4 SWINGER 1 SILENT WAR AND 3 ZUM ZUM These two horses stand out in this race and they should fight it out. It would come as a surprise if one of them does not win and the other will not be far behind him. VALUE BET RACE 6 NO 9 AULD MUG – EACHWAY This three-year-old gelding has only raced four times and although he finished unplaced in his first two races, he was not far behind the leading group. He followed that up with a third place and then came out and won over 1200m at Kenilworth. He makes his handicap debut and comes into this race over 1100m with just 54.5kg on his back and will be ridden by Grant van Niekerk. Aul Mug looks just the runner in this race t throw a few cats among the pigeons at a decent price.
