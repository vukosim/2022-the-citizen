Whilst his Orlando Pirates coach Mandla Ncikazi believes that Mamelodi Sundowns have already won the DStv Premiership title, winger Deon Hotto thinks Bucs are still much in the race to win it.

Despite the Brazilians (48 points) leading the standings with a massive 18 points gap, Hotto is adamant that there is still a long way to go to decide the champions of the 2021/22 league title. Hotto says Pirates are not only aiming to win the league, they are also eyeing the Nedbank Cup title. Bucs are in the last-16 round of the competition after beating in the round of 32. They will face Marumo Gallants in the next round. “No, no, no, it’s not over until it’s done. You have to believe. But, coming to the Nedbank, it’s a cup where we want to go all the way and lift it. It (the league) is not guaranteed yet. Definitely, yes (we have a chance). We must have the belief. It (the lead Downs have opened) looks unstoppable until it is unstoppable,” said the Namibian international. “We still have the belief. Seventeen points (now 18 after Sundowns drew 1-1 with Baroka on Tuesday) is a bit difficult, but we’ll see at the end.” Pirates will go into the clash against the KwaZulu-Natal based club having recorded two wins already this year, the victory against Usuthu and a 2-0 win over Algeria side JS Saoura in their opening Group B game of the Caf Confederation Cup. Meanwhile, Arrows, who are on 10th place on the log with 21 points from 16 games, head into the clash with Bucs after being eliminated from the Ke Yona Cup by Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila on penalties. Abafana Be’Sthende will be looking to forget about their woes in the cup competition and focus on climbing up the league standings. The last time these two sides met was in November last year, with the games ending in a goalless draw.
