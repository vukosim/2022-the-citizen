The former Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates player is said to have attended a number of trials with DStv Premiership teams, but he couldn’t impress. Apparently, there was a team in the GladAfrica Championship that wanted to offer him a contract, but the versatile player declined it. “I think it is just a matter of time before he calls it quits, he is just not seeing anything working for him. It’s been long now since he has been without a club and that is getting very worried, it’s stressful because now he is even contemplating to end his career once and focus on other things. “But, I think we will know what he is going to do by the end of the season, there aren’t many left, so, we will hear from him. But again, there was a team that wanted to sign him, but he rejected the offer,” said the insider.
