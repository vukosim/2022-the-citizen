Imagine having to tell your insurer that you crashed into a Lamborghini Gallardo? A truck driver who crashed into the luxury race car in Durban will be having that uncomfortable conversation with his insurer and employer after veering into the sleek white supercar on Saturday. While there were no injuries reported, the Lamborghini Gallardo was extensively damaged after a truck collided with it on the southbound lane of the R102 in the vicinity of Phoenix on Saturday.

It is alleged that a truck travelling next to the sports car suddenly veered into its lane resulting in the collision,” said Rusa spokesperson Prem Balram.
