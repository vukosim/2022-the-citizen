The highly-anticipated fifth generation of the Land Rover Range Rover was unveiled at a glitzy event in Johannesburg on Wednesday, but South African buyers will have to wait a little bit longer to get their hands on one.

What Jaguar Land Rover did confirm, is the local line-up which will consist of 19 models, and that the range will start at a price of R2.86-million. This is a modal window.
