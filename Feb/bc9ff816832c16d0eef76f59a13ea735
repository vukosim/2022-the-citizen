Kaizer Chiefs will not go head-to-head with Mamelodi Sundowns in the transfer market any time soon as Stuart Baxter remains conservative with how he spends the ‘chairman’s hard earned money’. ALSO READ: Ngcobo is not the best centre-back we have at Chiefs, says Baxter Baxter revealed this when he was asked about a comment he made recently when asked why Amakhosi had not done any business during the January transfer market.  He said at the time inasmuch as he would have liked to have Teboho Mokoena in his team at Naturena, they could not wrestle with Sundowns for the player’s signature.   “We will compete with them, but when they have spent over R40-million in this (January) window, then I don’t think we can go into a direct fight with them if it’s a question of who is going to put the most cash out,” said Baxter.  “I am sure Sundowns have an advantage over most teams, not just Chiefs. What I said is that we won’t add players to the squad unless it is value for money, unless we think that we are paying the chairman’s hard earned money and we are getting a player who will strengthen the squad.  “In many cases, we cannot compete with Sundowns if they go for the same player because they will throw more money at him. We want to compete with them but we are aware of their huge financial advantage,” he explained.
