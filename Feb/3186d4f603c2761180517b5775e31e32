The Bulls will unleash a solid starting front row which includes Gerhard Steenekamp at loosehead prop, Robert Hunt on the other side of the scrum and Schalk Erasmus starting in the No 2 jumper. “The team had a week’s break after the opening two matches of the Currie Cup season where we had an opportunity to work on areas that we felt we needed to improve,” said Smal. “We now have the tough task of facing a dangerous Cheetahs team who we know will give us a good challenge. We expect the side from Bloemfontein to come to Loftus Versfeld highly motivated, and they will give us both a physical and running game on Wednesday night. The match kicks off at 5.45pm on Wednesday.
