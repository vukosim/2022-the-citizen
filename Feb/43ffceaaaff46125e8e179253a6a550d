Sunday saw the latest season of Big Brother Mzansi, hosted by Lawrence Maleka, host its first few evictions on the show.  After last Sunday’s episode, where it was announced that no one would be evicted from the Big Brother house, this time viewers had the chance to vote for their favourite housemates and the ones who received the least votes had to leave.

It took the audience by surprise that Dinkybliss was evicted, as her fans wondered why they didn’t vote for her. Dinky was emotional on her exit but held her head up high.  Dinky was known to bring fun, laughs and drama in theBig Brother household and with her exit, viewers are convinced her absence will mean less drama which the other housemates think viewers want.  Mvelo’s exit however wasn’t as surprising. Before his eviction, he knew he had been nominated by his housemates to leave the house.  Mvelo said the housemates’ decision was based on a perceived threat he brought on the show and the high chances of him winning the R2 million prize.  When Mvelo entered the competition, the 28-year-old from Johannesburg described himself as loud and lovable.  He is a lover of people and passionate about education. Bubbly and candid, he hides a more complex side behind his infectious humour. Dinkybliss, is a 29-year-old from Johannesburg. Her real name is Rethabile Potsane and also described herself as “loud and proud”. She says she can transform people’s moods and lift spirits when she is around, which was the case during her time on the show.
