If Candice Bass-Robinson goes home from Kenilworth on Wednesday without at least a couple of scalps, she – and the punting public – will be nonplussed, to put it mildly. And the same goes for her stable jockey, Aldo Domeyer, who partners seven Bass-Robinson runners and will fancy his chances on all of them. The pair are poised to start the meeting on a high note with the favourites in the first two races, Maiden Juvenile Plate sprints in which their candidates are the ones with the most experience. Indeed, most of the opposition in these dashes are debutants and likely to be as green as the Cape Town turf. In Race 1, the filly Philosophise is having her third outing, after running a close second in her first, with a flying finish, and a third in her next, following a slow start and tangling with erratic gallopers. In Race 2, the colt Charlie Malone is expected to go one better than in his debut, when he was second. For All We Know is the Bass-Robinson-Domeyer hope in the third, a three-year-old filly who has shown improvement since being fitted with blinkers in her last two starts and looks due a win any day now. The team’s Race 4 candidate might be their best of the day. Silent War has come into form in recent months and is raring to win at the seventh time of asking. After that, Bass-Robinson and Domeyer team up with Dragonfly in the sixth, Barzalona in the seventh and Silent Trigger in the eighth – none of whom can be left out of any bets. The latter might be the second-best of the day.
