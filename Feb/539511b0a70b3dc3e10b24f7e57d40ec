For a long time, SuperSport United have been asking Iqraam Rayners to step up and take responsibility, particularly in the prolonged absence of lethal regular striker Bradley Grobler.

Rayners and SuperSport left it very late as they clinched a 1-0 win at the Harry Gwala Stadium, scoring in the 88th minute. The winger, who was playing as a makeshift striker,  scored his second goal of the season with a beautiful curler to slot past goalkeeper Marcel Engel Hardt. His teammate and Man-of-the-Match, Onismor Bhasera was beaming in confidence over Rayners’ effort, saying he knew once he broke free from the counter-attack, he would rattle the back of the net. “It was a relief to get that goal at the end … I believe we should have grabbed at least two or three goals in the first half and close the game. but well done to the guys. This gives us an advantage going into the league game and we are coming here again and it is going to be a fight but we are prepared. When we come again we will have to add a little bit of effort and make sure that we take all three points,” said Bhasera in an interview with SuperSport TV. In about a week, the sides meet again and knowing that the Team of Choice are wounded, Bhasera says Matsatsantsa A Pitori will need to double their efforts when they travel to the Harry Gwala Stadium for their resumption of the DStv Premiership. “I was quite happy for him (Rayners) and I think he deserved a goal because he has been working very hard for it. The most important thing for me is that he kept on fighting and he never gave up. Overall, the performance was very good and the fight that we showed here is the cornerstone of our team. We have a good work ethic and I think we showed that,” he added
