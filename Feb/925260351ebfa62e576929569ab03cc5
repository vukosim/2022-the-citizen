Following their goalless stalemate with Golden Arrows in the DStv Premiership clash, Orlando Pirates defender Paseka Mako believes the Buccaneers display was poor and they were supposed to win the match. The 0-0 draw with the KwaZulu-Natal based club at the Orlando Stadium on Wednesday saw the Soweto club register their 10th draw of the season in their last 20 league games, with the club having only secured seven wins and lost three matches.

They came at us by playing crosses and we were supposed to close the crosses early. So, for me, I am not happy,” said the Bucs defender. “Even if you check on the log, we are not safe. We are number two and other teams are winning. So, we have to win our home games.” But, Pirates remained in second place after the result, with the club having collected 31 points so far in the league. They, however, trail log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns with a huge 17 points, as the Pretoria side managed to claim 48 points in 21 fixtures. Pirates have a huge task to try and close the gap between and the runaway league leaders, Downs, and Bucs’ position on the league standings is not safe, with the likes of Stellenbosch FC, Kaizer Chiefs and Royal AM just behind their tails. Stellies are on 30 points after 19 games,  just one point behind Bucs, whereas fourth placed Amakhosi and fifth placed Royal AM are level on 29 points having played 17 and 18 games respectively.
