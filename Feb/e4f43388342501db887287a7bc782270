Not known for entertaining or responding to online trolls, supermodel Kendall Jenner put her foot down with the latest rumours circling about her on the internet.  There was a term being thrown around that Kendall is known as the “pick me up” girl, after an old clip from the final season of Keep Up With the Kardashians resurfaced.   In the video, Kendall is playing volleyball with her famous sisters and jokes that she was built like an athlete.  “I did this blood test. They told me that I’m super athletic and I’m built for this s***,” she told Khloé Kardashian.  The “Pick me up” term, according to the Urban Dictionary, means “a girl who goes out of their way to impress boys and make them seem that they’re ‘not like other girls’. Kind of like a simp but for girls. Otherwise known as internalised misogyny.” ALSO READ: Kylie Jenner and Travis welcome second child – a baby boy Kendall was aware this term was being used on the interweb to describe her and in response she posted a video of herself on TikTok, crashing face-first into the snow while failing to land a snowboarding jump during her trip to Aspen, Colorado.  Hilariously, she added the audio of herself calling herself an athlete, captioning it: “It’s giving ‘pick me’ vibes.” Her winter wonderland trip in Aspen has grabbed much attention after she broke the internet for wearing a skimpy black bikini with over the top fur boots, posing on a thick bed of snow.  She is reportedly vacationing with her friends but not with her NBA boyfriend Devin Brooker.  Kendall and Devin have been tight-lipped about their relationship status but went official on Valentine’s Day 2021, when Kendall posted a cute snap on her Instagram story of the Phoenix Suns player cuddling her on top of a kitchen surface and had a huge grin on her face.
