David Kriel will make a return to the Bulls side on Saturday, starting at fullback in the United Rugby Championship clash with the Sharks at Loftus Versfeld, while Cornal Hendricks will also earn a starting berth on the right wing in the only changes to the backline in the home team’s starting XV. Gerhard Steenekamp will be the only new face to the forwards pack that started against the Lions last week. He changes spots with Simphiwe Matanzima, who moves to the bench in a rotational switch. The Bulls are wary of the threat from a Springbok-laden Sharks side that will be looking to bounce back after suffering a defeat against the Stormers last week.

We can look forward to a thrilling game” Bulls David Kriel, Cornal Hendricks, Lionel Mapoe, Harold Vorster, Madosh Tambwe, Morne Steyn, Zak Burger , Elrigh Louw, Arno Botha, Marcell Coetzee (capt), Ruan Nortje, Walt Steenkamp, Jacques van Rooyen, Johan Grobbelaar, Gerhard Steenekamp Bench: Bismarck du Plessis, Simphiwe Matanzima, Robert Hunt, Janko Swanepoel, Muller Uys, Embrose Papier, Chris Smith, Canan Moodie
