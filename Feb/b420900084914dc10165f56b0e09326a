The Cape Town summer season reaches its conclusion with a gaudily packaged fixture at Kenilworth on Saturday – headlined by the Grade 1 Jonsson Workwear Cape Derby, a famous old race with a line-up of bright young things. Hot-pot favourite for the Derby is Double Superlative, a colt that champion trainer Justin Snaith has reputedly earmarked as his next big star. The son of Twice Over ran a good fourth place in the Cape Town Met a month ago, 1.70 lengths off winner Kommetdieding – in a race that three-year-olds do not usually shine in. That effort – over this same 2000m of turf as Saturday’s contest – got the handicappers excited and they hiked his merit rating from 111 to 125 overnight. Of course, that’s not material on Saturday as the Derby three-year-olds are all allotted 60kg. But it does mean he’s the best-weighted horse in the race – by far. Before the Met, Double Superlative won the 1600m Cape Guineas in facile fashion, also at Kenilworth. Anton Marcus rode him in both those races and will know by now what makes the fellow tick. But it’s not a one-horse race. Anton’s nephew, Adam Marcus, has Universal in the race. This colt completed a perfect prep for this task when winning the 1800m Politician Stakes on Met day. Prior to that, he had a rough passage in the Guineas and finished some four lengths off Double Superlative. Given an untroubled run, he should finish a lot closer to the talking horse – with the extra ground also being in his favour. Master Redoute was second in the Politician, eating up ground towards the end, and can’t be rated much below Universal. His trainer and jockey, Andre Nel and Grant van Niekerk, are a deadly combo. Early betting support has come for Never Ending Rain, for whom Glen Kotzen has secured the services of powerful Highveld rider Gavin Lerena. Consideration should also be given to Pomp And Power, Senso Unico and Global Ally. Derby day also has a host of supporting features, including the Grade 2 Diadem Stakes and the Grade 3 Prix Du Cap. There is also a fandango of prawns and tunes, with the whole event being titled The Cape Town Seafood and Jazz Festival. Plus, a R500,000 carryover is likely to boost the Pick 6 pot to R3 million.
