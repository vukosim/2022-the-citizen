Getting hair treatments on a regular basis by professional hair dressers can be quite costly, and if you are a busy person with a hectic schedule then it can be pretty difficult to honour hair appointments as well. While there are thousands of haircare products available to grow, thicken and protect your hair, choosing the right one for your hair can be very overwhelming and expensive.  This hair treatment using rice water has been proven to be highly effective in growing hair faster, strengthening your hair, and growing your hair longer than its usual length.  A TikTok user shared a video on how she makes her rice water treatment to grow her hair longer and faster, and to also make her hair strong.  In the video, she begins by pouring some rice into a shallow, long plastic container, and then adding water to the container to cover the rice completely.  She then mixes the rice and water until the water changes and starts to appear milky from the rice.

The next step is to spray the rice water directly onto your hair, and then leaving it in for 2-8 hours before washing it out of your hair.  A verified Beverly Hills doctor, Dr Brian Boxer Wechter, took to TikTok to create a duet with the rice water video, and to let his followers know that using rice water as a hair treatment does indeed work.  Brian explained that the rice water blocks the hormone DHG, which causes hair loss, which is why your hair will grow faster, thicker and longer with the rice water treatment.
