American actor and producer Tom Cruise will be shooting part of the eighth instalment of the Mission: Impossible movie series very close to home.  And locals may soon catch a glimpse of Cruise and the star-studded cast of Mission: Impossible 8. This was revealed on a local Facebook group earlier this week, after aeroplanes used to shoot the movie were spotted in Hoedspruit, Letaba Herald reports.  Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise will once again reprise the role of agent Ethan Hunt.  Plot details remain a closely guarded secret, but the theme said to run through Mission: Impossible 7 and Mission: Impossible 8hints at the two movies being Hunt’s last missions.  An insider told Variety the seventh movie ends with a cliff-hanger, and that the latest two Mission Impossible films represent a wrap of the entire series.  Cruise has played the role of Hunt for over 20 years, with Mission: Impossible first released in 1996.  Delayed significantly by Covid-19, the movies were set to be released last year and this year, but will instead arrive in 2023 and 2024.  The series has grossed more than $3 billion worldwide.  Compiled by Nica Richards.
