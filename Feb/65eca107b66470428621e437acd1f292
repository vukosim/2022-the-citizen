The transfer period has come and gone and to be fair, this was one of the least exciting windows in recent as there are hardly any marquee signings in the whole of the Premier Soccer League. For a player like Aubrey Ngoma, however, he still has a chance to secure himself a contract as free agents can join any team any time.The former Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns winger has been training with SuperSport United of late and the club’s skipper, Ronwen Williams, wishes he was the decision maker so that he could hand the well-travelled Ngoma a contract.“He is experienced and he has been around since he played for two out of the top three teams in the country so it could be a wonderful signing for us,” said Williams.“He has played one or two friendlies with us and he has done fairly well and he is working hard everyday and he is showing that hunger. He needs to make use of this opportunity and I would be glad if he signs for us because he is a winger who scores goals and I think we have lacked that this season and in the last few seasons where a winger can chip in between five and 10 goals… he brings that, we know he can score goals,” Williams added.Williams says having a player like Ngoma in their ranks would help where the goals are concerned, seeing that Matsatsantsa A Pitori’s main goal-getter, Bradley Grobler, is not having the best of seasons, having netted just one goal in the DStv campaign so far.“We miss him massively because if we take away all the goals he scored last season then we would have struggled because he scored 16 goals and that means in the last two seasons he has scored close to 30 goals for us. He has just been unfortunate with injury and he got sick with Covid-19,” Williams said.“It is just one of those seasons where things did not go well for him, but Thamsanqa Gabuza has stepped up and it is also for the other guys to step up, your Gamphani Lungu, Iqraam Reyners and others. They can’t just be squad players, they need to show their worth and chip in some goals and hopefully it could come right for us,” he added.
