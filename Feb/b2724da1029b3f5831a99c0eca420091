Kuwait’s constitutional court on Wednesday overturned a law that criminalises “imitation of the opposite sex” in a move Amnesty International said was a breakthrough for transgender rights in the region.  Kuwaiti lawyer Ali al-Aryan, who filed a lawsuit to overturn Article 198 of the penal code two years ago, confirmed that the law had been overturned, saying it violated personal freedoms, which are stipulated in the constitution.  “The law was overly vague and broad, and we based our defence on the existence of medical and consitutional foundations, as there are hormonal as well as psychological contributors,” he told AFP.  Amnesty welcomed the court’s decision, saying it marked “a major breakthrough” for transgender rights in the region.  This is a modal window.
