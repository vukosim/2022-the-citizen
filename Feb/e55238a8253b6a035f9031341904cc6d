After two weeks of camp and the arrival of overseas based players this week, Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis says there was massive preparation for their tie with Algeria in the first leg of the last round of the Caf Africa Women’s Cup of Nations at Orlando Stadium on Friday.

We just needed to come to the field and try to do similar things. It’s now up to the players,” said the Banyana coach. “We are used to this weather even though a group of our players come from Europe and some of their players come from Europe as well, even though it’s overcast it’s still hot and we have to take advantage of that and the fact that we are playing at home to make sure that we get positive results to make the second leg much easier.” Ellis also stressed the importance of not undermining their opponents and added that her troops need to be up for the challenge. “We know that it won’t be an easy game, Algeria has shown that they are a powerful team in the African continent and can’t be taken lightly and we keep repeating that message over and over to the players. They will be up for it and likewise we have to be up for it and we have to be better.”
