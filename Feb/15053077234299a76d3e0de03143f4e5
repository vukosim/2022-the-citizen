The finalists for the Sasol League National Championships title contenders have been confirmed, after City Lads Ladies and Vasco Da Gama Ladies won their respective semi-finals against Lindelani Ladies and Croesus Ladies FC at the King Zwelithini Stadium on Friday. The sides have also earned promotion to the Hollywoodbets Super League for next season, after Lads beat Lindelani 3-2, while Vasco defeated Croesus 4-3 on penalties after the match ended 1-1. Nandipha Booi gave City lads a great start into the game, with the defender scoring from a free-kick, while the home side was struggling to get forward in the first half. In the second half, things would turn out for the worst for Lindelani after they conceded a penalty. Booi stepped up to take the spot-kick and calmly slotted the ball into the back of the net to make it 2-0 for the Eastern Cape club and grab a brace for herself. With about 10 minutes left of regular time, Lindelani would pull one goal back after Nomfundo Xulu scored from close range following some brilliant work by Basetsana player Zethembiso Vilakazi. Vilakazi went on to turn things around for Lindelani and scored to make it 2-2 late in the tie. With the game seemingly going to the end, it was Booi again to the rescue for City Lads, scoring from another free-kick to make it 3-2 for the Eastern Cape club and take them to the final with a hat-trick for herself. It was the battle of Gauteng and Eastern Cape in the final, with Croesus and Vascoâ€™s clash also expected to be nothing short of fireworks. Miche Minnies scored early in the game to put Vasco in the driving seat, but Lerato Makhanya cancelled the lead from a penalty spot, leaving the game to go into the penalties at the completion, where Vasco ended up as winners.
