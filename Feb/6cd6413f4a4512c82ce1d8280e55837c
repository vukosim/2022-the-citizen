The nominees for the 23rd annual Laureus World Sport Awards, revealed today, include some of the greatest athletes on the planet. The world’s media have voted across seven categories to honour the sportsmen, sportswomen and teams who set new standards in a year like no other. Tom Brady, Ashleigh Barty, Robert Lewandowski and Elaine Thompson-Herah are among the sporting icons hoping to see their name on one of the famous Laureus statuettes at this year’s awards. Also nominated are members of a generation of athletes who broke new ground: we may not have known names such as Emma Raducanu, Pedri or Momiji Nishiya 12 months ago, but their achievements drove these teenagers to the top of their sports, and that’s where they plan to stay. As the pandemic continued in 2021, fans were not always present to take part when the biggest shows in sport returned. The delayed Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo, football’s European Championship – both postponed from 2020 – and other elite tournaments and events found a way to take place safely.  Sometimes we had to watch from afar and the athletes had to perform without support or atmosphere, adding pressure to their performance.   Four Olympians compete in the category of Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year, and each claimed their own piece of history.  On the track, Elaine Thompson-Herah emulated her fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt with golds in the 100, 200 and 4 x 100metre relay, while Allyson Felix became the USA’s most decorated track-and-field Olympian.  In the pool, Emma McKeon’s four gold and three bronze medals tied the record for the most won by a woman at a single Games, and Katie Ledecky, who added two gold and two silver medals to become the most decorated female swimmer in Olympic history.  Also short-listed are world No 1 tennis player Ashleigh Barty, who won Wimbledon, and Alexia Putellas, Champions League winner with FC Barcelona and the winner of the Ballon d’Or. The Tokyo Games also provided two of our nominees for theLaureus World Sportsman of the Year Award:Caeleb Dressel, who won five golds in the pool, and Eliud Kipchoge, who defended his title in the marathon.  They are up against former winner Novak Djokovic, Bayern Munich’s star striker Robert Lewandowski and Max Verstappen, who won the Formula One Drivers’ Championship on a dramatic final race day in Abu Dhabi. The list is completed by Tom Brady, who led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to victory in Super Bowl LV and established himself as the greatest quarterback in NFL history.
