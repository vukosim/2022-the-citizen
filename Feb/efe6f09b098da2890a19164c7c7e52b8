Racing is a cruel mistress – as the Mike de Kock stable will have felt after Tuesday’s delayed Gauteng Guineas meeting at Turffontein. An impressive victory for Safe Passage in the WSB Guineas had the flush cooled by below-par showings of the trainer’s other fancied runners – notably hot-pot Desert Miracle’s chilling eclipse in the Wilgerbosdrift Fillies Guineas. The seductive yet fickle game was ever thus. The De Kock team gets a chance to kindle the flames of ardour once more at the Vaal on Thursday, when they send out several horses with reasonable winning chances. The most likely among them is Sybaris, a royally bred filly from Ireland who has been eased back into form after a debut win and a subsequent six-month break. In two January outings, the daughter of Fastnet Rock showed signs of having the capacity to fulfil her pedigree promise. Under the capable hands of Kabelo Matsunyane, from a good draw, she should have the measure of run-of-the-mill opposition in Race 4, a Classified Stakes over 1700m. Verolina, a locally bred filly by Vercingetorix, is the De Kock yard’s next best on the day as she lines up in Race 6, a FM80 Handicap over 1200m. This one is in handicap company for the first time after a debut win 21 days ago, an initial step up that not all young horses find elementary. However, Verolina has shown signs of superior quality, with three runner-up finishes before her breakthrough, and would not be a surprise follow-up winner here. In the lucky last, Race 8, five-year-old mare Tallinn could carry De Kock’s personal silks into the money. Also by Vercingetorix, she is willing, consistent and aiming for a fourth win in her 17th start – and cannot be left out of any exotic-bets reckoning.
