Best Bet:  Race 3: Black Thorn (2) to win. Trained by Sean Tarry, this Pomodoro gelding is unbeaten in three runs over 2400m and has the added incentive of completing a hat-trick. Value Bet:  Race 6: Swinger: Box Crusade To Royalty (6), Three Hills (10) and Gilda Gray (13) Crusade To Royalty has two career wins to her name, both over this distance. Three Hills attempted 1800m first up out the maidens and finished second. She has the benefit of a 2,5kg claim. Gilda Gray has battled since her maiden win, but her third place finish last time out over 1700m suggests she will come into her own over the extra.
