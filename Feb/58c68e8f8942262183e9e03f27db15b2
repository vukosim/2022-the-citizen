A KwaZulu-Natal police officer in full uniform was found by a group of schoolchildren in a compromised position, visibly drunk in broad daylight and hanging onto a pole for balance.  The video first emerged on social media on Thursday, but was received by the Osizweni Saps station commander on Wednesday.  In the cringe-worthy clip, the confused officer is helped up by a young woman in her school uniform, while the person filming the incident can be heard laughing hysterically.  ALSO READ: WATCH: #KarateCop loses his cool, attacks his colleagues With his service pistol dangling on his hip, the officer eventually manages to stand on his own two feet, thanking the girl for helping him with a cross-eyed handshake, before the video ends.  Police spokesperson Jay Naicker confirmed the incident, and said the man was identified as a sergeant stationed at Osizweni Saps.  A day after the incident, police went to the sergeant’s home and seized his service pistol “for safekeeping”. It is believed the incident took place last Friday.  A departmental investigation has since been registered against the sergeant.  NOW READ: WATCH: ‘Drunk’ cop passed out on the side of the road Compiled by Nica Richards.
