Two schoolchildren died in a car crash after a taxi was sideswiped by a truck on the R103 near Rosetta, Mooi River, on Friday afternoon. Midlands Emergency Services spokesperson Roland Roberston described the accident scene as “gruesome”. “The taxi was transporting schoolchildren back home from school when it was sideswiped by the truck. One scholar was dragged by the truck and another was ejected from the taxi,” said Robertson.  Both of the children passed away before the emergency services crew arrived at the crash scene. Robertson said six children sustained mild to moderate injuries and were transported to various hospitals for treatment. The remaining eight children that were travelling in the taxi were assessed on scene and did not required any further medical treatment.
