Moja Love says the teen pregnancy statistics in South Africa are frightening and that their new show, Teenage Pregnancy, is a documentary that will continue to shine the spotlight on the issue.  Teenage Pregnancy documents three teens- Ntando, Zanele and Amo, all aged 17, and their journey to becoming teenage mothers. Each episode follows these teenagers as they navigate through adulthood and pregnancy. The soon-to-be teen moms’ stories will look into how they tackle challenges in their families, friends, schools, religion and gossip.

The Gauteng health department reported that there were more than 23,000 teenage pregnancies confirmed in Gauteng from April 2020 to March 2021.
