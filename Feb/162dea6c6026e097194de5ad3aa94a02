The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) says some primary caregivers have expressed outrage over the age limits on government child support grants. The grants expire when the child turns 18, but caregivers say that government’s child support grants should continue if the child is still at school, regardless of their age. “Sassa would like to clarify to primary caregivers of child support grant beneficiaries that the grant is only meant for children between the ages of 0-18 years, as soon as the child reaches the age of 18 years the grant lapses,” said the social security agency in a statement. “The reason for the need to clarify is the outcry from caregivers that their grants have lapsed because their children have attained the age of 18 years but they are still at school. “The fact that the child is still at school does not qualify them to receive the child support grant as it is only caters for children from the ages between 0-18 years,” reiterates the office. The following conditions need to be met in order to qualify for the child support grant: “Sassa encourages unemployed South Africans who are in need of government support and between the ages 18 and 59 years to apply for the Special Covid-19 R350 SRD Grant using the Sasssa website or WhatsApp: 082 046 8553.” Make sure to include your name, surname and ID number in the WhatsApp message.
