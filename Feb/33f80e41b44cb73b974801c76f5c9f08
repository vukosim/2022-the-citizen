Exciting No 8 Sikhumbuzo Notshe makes a return to action for the Sharks in their Currie Cup match against Western Province in Durban on Wednesday. Notshe has spent the last eight months on the sidelines with a knee injury he picked up in May last year. He underwent surgery for the problem. The side will be led by centre Marius Louw and also includes Werner Kok, Yaw Penxe, Curwin Bosch and Inny Radebe, who previously played for the Sharks and most recently captained the EP Elephants under the guidance of Peter de Villiers. Radebe will wear the No 15 jersey. Both sides have one win apiece, although Province have played two matches while the Sharks have had just the solitary game â€“ a 24-23 victory over Griquas in their only fixture to date.Neither team has played in two weeks, with Province suffering a 40-21 loss to the log leading Blue Bulls in their last tournament outing and both sides will be looking to put in a clinical performance that renders valuable log points.Sharks: Inny Radebe, Yaw Penxe, Werner Kok, Marius Louw (capt), Marnus Potgieter, Curwin Bosch, Cameron Wright, Celimpilo Gumede, James Venter, Reniel Hugo, Emile van Heerden, Lourens Adriaanse, Fez Mbatha, Khwezi Mona.
