The minister will also provide details about how the priorities outlined in President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (Sona) will be funded. The budget speech is the most significant event after the Sona, and Godongwana faces a difficult task in balancing the books amid South Africa’s sluggish economic growth and increasing unemployment rate.  According to Miyelani Mkhabela, chief executive and chief economist at Antswisa Transaction Advisory, the minister is expected to allocate a higher percentage of the budget to economic development, covering special economic zones (SEZs) that can boost economic growth, economic development and job creation. Mkhabela said Godongwana must give assurances to the nation on the South African debt restructuring mechanisms and the agreed revised repayments terms, as the International Monetary Fund has expressed concern that South Africa’s outlook remains precarious.
