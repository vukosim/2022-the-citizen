FAIRVIEW BEST BET RACE 1 SWINGER: NO 1 CRUISE CONTROL AND 2 FOREST SPY Trainer Gavin Smith has his horses firing and his two juveniles in the opening race both look like likely to fight out the finish. Cruise Control was very speedy on debut and won in a fast time. Admittedly, that form was overturned completely at Kenilworth when the runner-up, Cliff Top, won and Cruise Control ran a disappointing seventh. Stable companion Forest Spy was slowly away but still showed promise when third behind rival-in-this-race Bouquet. Both were making their debuts. Forest Spy showed he has come on from that performance when a good winner last week. VALUE BET RACE 2 NO 1 V V POWER – EACHWAY This is another Gavin Smith runner who looked to have a bright future but then lost his way. But he suddenly showed improvement last time when ridden by apprentice Kaidan Brewer. He led for most of the 1200m but was caught close home. Brewer is back on board again so one can expect further improvement in this race. At 8-1 he looks an attractive proposition.
