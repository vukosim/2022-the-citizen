The two sides, a Goliath and a David if we look at it in Biblical terms, meet in a Nedbank Cup Last 32 fixture at FNB Stadium on Saturday at 6pm.  Galaxy owner and president, Tim Sukazi has on numerous occasions professed his will to have his side always come out victorious when they play Amakhosi.  This came after they managed to upset the millions of Amakhosi supporters when they beat they favourite team 1-0 in the final of the same competition some three years ago while they were first division campaigners.  READ ALSO: Lekay has learnt his lessons, now wants to flourish – starting against Chiefs But Amakhosi are not willing to roll over and accept whatever is meted out by the Rockets and defender Njabulo Blom says they are aiming beyond their first fixture in Ke Yona. “We are working very hard leading up to this game. The guys are gelling well with the coaches and the technical team and our aim is to get to move beyond Saturday’s game and get into the next round,” Blom told the club’s website. “Growing up and seeing Chiefs win trophies, it was always my ambition to do the same. Surely I am not the only one who grew up supporting Chiefs and wanting to be here and winning trophies with the team. Now that I am here, it is something that I will work on with the guys to make our dreams come true,” said Blom.
