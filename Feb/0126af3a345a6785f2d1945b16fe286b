Before answering a question about his memories of the Nedbank Cup, Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma took a deep sigh before responding.

When the coaches trusted me and I started playing it was in this cup. I know how big it is and how important it is.  “We are looking forward to it as a team. We are playing TS Galaxy and we know how they play, I believe we have prepared well. We are ready for them,” he said. But it is the very same Galaxy that forced Bvuma to swallow one of the most difficult results of his career when they beat them 1-0 in the final of the same competition three years ago.   “Uhh… The last one I played was painful – that is when we lost to TS Galaxy in the final back in 2019. That is why we are looking forward to playing them, getting past them and going all the way and winning it.” Bvuma has recently returned to Amakhosi after spending just over a week with Warriors in the DStv Compact Cup. He came back and was greeted with a contract extension at Naturena.      “I have been working and I am just back from winning the Compact Cup. I have also just renewed my contract – it has been a dream playing for Kaizer Chiefs. And that they trusted me to renew means a lot to me and that I continue to live my dream.  “It can only be the grace of God (that keeps me going) because there is nothing special about me, honestly. I just keep praying and working hard while keeping away from trouble. I just do the right things and do extra work,” says Bvuma.
