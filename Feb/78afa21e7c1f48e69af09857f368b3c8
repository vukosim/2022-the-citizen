All the key horses stood their ground and that will see 11 runners carded to go to post for the R1-million Jonsson Workwear Cape Derby over 2000m at Kenilworth on Saturday. There were only two withdrawals – Mike de Kock-trained Motown Magic and Dean Kannemeyer’s Gimme A Star – at yesterday’s declaration stage. As expected, Justin Snaith comes into this race with a potent hand which comprises Grade 1 Cape Guineas winner and Cape Town Met fourth-placed Double Superlative, along with Pomp And Power, who was runner-up in the Guineas and fifth in the L’Ormarins Queen’s Plate, beaten just 3.05 lengths by Jet Dark. The main threat to the Snaith runners is likely to come from Universal, a half-brother to Vardy. For the full version of Tuesday’s edition of Racing Express, as found in The Citizen, click here. The Adam Marcus-trained runner suffered some severe interference when unplaced in the Guineas but proved his me le with victory in the Grade 3 Politician Stakes over 1800m on Cape Met day. The son of Gimmethegreenlight is a winner of three of his six races and is likely to benefit from the additional 200m of the Derby. Those three are the best-weighted runners by quite a long way but there some improving runners in the line-up who could give some cheek. The Derby is one of seven features run on a day punctuated with some exceptional runners. There is also a Pick 6 carryover of R500,000 at the meeting with a likely pool of R3 million.
