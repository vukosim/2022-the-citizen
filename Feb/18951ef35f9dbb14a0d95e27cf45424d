Residents in Pretoria East will have to endure a 12-hour water outage starting Monday due to a planned shutdown during which Rand Water will carry out maintenance repairs.  This is the third water shut down in February. Several parts of Tshwane were affected by water supply problems earlier this month due to a power failure at a Rand Water booster station. Rand Water will install tie-ins and meter connections on the newly installed pipeline, starting at 5pm on Monday, 28 February.  If everything goes according to plan, the work will be completed by 5am on Tuesday, 1 March.  The reservoirs in the following affected areas will be filled before the shutdown: On 19 February, Rand Water has closed off the water supply from the Vlakfontein Reservoir which supplies parts of regions three, four and six – largely the eastern part of Pretoria. The City of Tshwane’s Water and Sanitation Department said it was not informed that the water supply was cut, but it turns out the reservoir was closed for repair work from Friday. “The city was not informed by Rand Water about this shutdown of the supply and we are escalating the matter,” said Water and Sanitation MMC Phillip Nel. The City of Tshwane called on residents to “save water and use it sparingly at all times.” ALSO READ: Pretoria East water outage: Supply restored ahead of schedule Compiled by Cheryl Kahla; additional reporting by Narissa Subramoney
