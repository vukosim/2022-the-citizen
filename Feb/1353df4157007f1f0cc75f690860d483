Keagan Dolly says it is good that the games are coming thick and fast because that has afforded Kaizer Chiefs players little time to dwell on their disappointing showing in the Nedbank Cup. ALSO READ: Kaizer Chiefs set to keep Baxter despite Cup exit Amakhosi were knocked out of the Nedbank Cup by a valiant TS Galaxy last weekend. The Rockets beat Chiefs 1-0 at FNB Stadium, putting paid to their chances of any kind of silverware this season.  “Obviously, we are very disappointed, not only because we lost but also because of the way we played. I don’t think we were ourselves on the day,” says Dolly.  “Our movement off-the-ball, our pressing shape… I think it wasn’t us. It is good that we have a game on Tuesday so we can rectify our mistakes and get our confidence back.  “The game on Tuesday is a chance for everyone to come back and try to do our best to win on the day.”  Amakhosi visit another gallant side Cape Town City in the Mother City for a DStv Premiership fixture on Tuesday evening.   “We all know it is not easy going to Cape Town, City are a good team and they are good on the ball and like to play it, so it is going to be a good game. It is important for us to come back in this game.  Dolly took stock of the disaster the TS Galaxy defeat has sent Chiefs into. “Each and every season we want to compete for trophies. We want to win trophies for ourselves, for the club and the supporters. I think it was disappointing going out like that especially so early in the competition and now we shift our league to the league.  “We should do our best to finish as high as we can. It starts on Tuesday.  “After the game we were sad, but it is good that we have a game coming so we can shift the focus. On Sunday we were still in shock and today (Monday) they are really excited for tomorrow (Tuesday) and we will prepare well and do our best to win it for the team.”
