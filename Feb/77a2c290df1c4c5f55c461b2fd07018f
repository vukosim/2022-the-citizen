TURFFONTEIN INSIDE TRACK BEST BET RACE 7 NO 2 ABOUT TO STORM – WIN Johan Janse van Vuuren’s runner takes a massive drop in class and should be far too good for his opposition. In his last three races, the average merit rating was 86 and he still managed to be competitive and place. The average merit rating for this race is 72, and that should make him a banker in all bets. VALUE BET RACE 8: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT NO 1 ABALUS AND NO 9 URBAN ROCKE WITH THE FIELD This a Quartet which has potential for a big payout as it is wide open. Both Abalus and Urban Rock have good form at this course and both have landed excellent draws, something vital over 1000m on the Inside track as they race over the minimum trip around the turn. The cost of a full bet is R1080 but one can take a percentage and each percent will cost just R10.80.
