Majavu also revealed that four clubs have been cautioned by the PSL for failing to adhere to Covid-19 protocols.  “There have been four clubs that have been issued letters of reprimand for failure to comply with Covid related protocols.  (And) Even though the league has not issued them with fines, we regarded the matters sufficiently important to bring to the attention of the affected clubs so that in future if they do not heed the warning, then formal charges will be preferred against them.”  Majavu did not divulge the names of the four clubs.
