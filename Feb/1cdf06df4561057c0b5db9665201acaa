Volkswagen’s Director for Commercial Vehicles in Australia has become the first executive in any country to officially open-up about the prospects of a hardscore R version of the incoming all-new Ford Ranger-based Amarok. A model that has attracted widespread attention since being rumoured by Germany’s AutoBild in 2020, Ryan Davies, in an interview with carsguide.com.au, admitted that an Amarok R is “definitely an option” that is being investigated. While more than likely to derive motivation from the Ford-supplied 3.0-litre turbodiesel V6 engine formally used in the F-150, the Amarok R’s future, according to the report, could face objection from its alliance partner in the shape of its willingness to provide Wolfsburg with the blueprints for the Raptor.

While the Amarok R continues to be shrouded in mystery, a preview, should it become reality, will be provided later this month when Ford officially reveals the second generation Raptor based on the new Ranger. Already spied on a number of occasions, the last being towards the end of January with minimum layers of disguise, the Raptor is expected to benefit from a number of changes underneath its new skin, though exact details remain unknown. What is known though is that it will be offered with a petrol engine for the first engine, which rumours have alleged could either be the 231kW/540Nm 2.7 EcoBoost V6 from the Bronco, or the 298kW/563Nm twin-turbo 3.0 EcoBoost V6 used in the Explorer ST and now in the Bronco Raptor. Since the Amarok R is not being considered for North America, it will only be equipped with the mentioned six-cylinder oil-burner and not the 221 kW four-cylinder AutoBild had mentioned. Due to be revealed later this year as evident by the most recent teaser sketch, and by first pre-production spy shot in September, expect more details of the Amarok to emerge over the coming weeks, including the likeness of the R becoming official.
