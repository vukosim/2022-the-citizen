She has been priced up at 15-10 with Desert Miracle, who started at 1-3 for the Gauteng Fillies Guineas, at 16-10. Both horses won their respective races impressively and it is going to take a good horse to stop either of them from completing the Triple Crown and Triple Tiara. For the most they will be meeting the same horses they faced in the Guineas, but one runner who will create a lot of interest in the SA Classic is unbeaten Zeus. There is a supplementary entry stage on Monday with declarations closing at 11am on Tuesday 1 March. Also run on the 10-race card are the Grade 2 Hawaii Stakes over 1400m and the Listed Aquanaut Handicap over 2400m.The final leg of the Triple Crown is the Grade 1 SA Derby over 2450m while the final leg of the Triple Tiara is the Grade 2 SA Oaks.
