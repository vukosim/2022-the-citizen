The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has congratulated the South African Police Service (SAPS) officers for their bravery in responding to the botched cash-in-transit heist on Monday. “It is precisely this type of determined response that the SAPS must continue with, so as to send a firm warning to all criminals in South Africa that we have declared war on crime. The spiralling levels of crime in South Africa demand a firm and direct response,” said the EFF in a statement on Tuesday. “We wish the police officers who were injured a speedy recovery and send our appreciation to them and their families for their selfless service in defending our country against criminals. May the bravery and authority of the SAPS continue in our war against crime.” According to a crime scene report by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), 18 members from different units and the Johannesburg Metro Police Department were involved in the crackdown.  One police officer from the chopper, two police officers from Mofatt view SAPS and one Metro police officers were injured.
