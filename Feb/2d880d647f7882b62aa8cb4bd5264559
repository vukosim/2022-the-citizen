I met him recently and he said he was considering leaving football forever if nothing comes up soon. “He said someone was trying to organise him a move to one of the Limpopo teams but if that doesn’t come right, he will consider going back home to Ghana,” said the source. Another source said Darpoh had become arrogant at Usuthu after he became a regular player. “He was walking around like he owned the place. That was when he was a regular under then coach (Jozef) Vukusic. Apparently he (Vukusic) had been praising him and telling him he would organise for him to move overseas. “But when he was fired, he left him behind and never helped him go overseas like he had promised,” said the source.
