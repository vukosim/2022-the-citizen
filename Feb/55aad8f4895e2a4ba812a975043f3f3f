Mixed fortunes might be a tactful way to describe Grant van Niekerk’s experiences on Cape Town Met day at Kenilworth. The popular jockey started Saturday like a house on fire, clocking up two wins in the first four races, but then things went pear-shaped as a succession of his well-fancied rides on the big day were touched off or just plain flopped. However, “GvN” has plenty of bouncebackability and could grab some consolation at the same venue on Tuesday. Indeed, it would be folly to leave him out of any leg of the Pick 6. Van Niekerk appears to have had the pick of champion trainer Justin Snaith’s runners at the meeting. Black Silver in Race 3, Silver Darling in Race 6, Different Face in Race 6 and Kwinta’s Light in Race 7 all have bright chances. Red Lark and Magnetic Dime for Andre Nel – in the fourth and eighth – make up the jockey’s Pick 6 and both must be seriously considered. An All To Come bet, with a Win on Black Silver and a Place on Magnetic Dime, might be a tempting proposition. Throw in another of your fancies to spice it up.
