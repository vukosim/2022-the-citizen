Former Proteas captain Faf du Plessis, recently retired Test player Quinton de Kock, rising star Marco Jansen and forgotten batting powerhouse Rilee Rossouw are among 33 South Africans looking for an India Premier League home in the next few weeks. The 2022 auction happens in Bangalore on 12 and 13 February with 370 Indians and 220 overseas players hoping to catch the attention of the 10 franchise owners. Two new teams will join the competition this year, namely Ahmedabad and Lucknow. The 2022 competition – the 15th – is due to start at the end of March and run until the end of May. The Chennai Super Kings, for whom Du Plessis has played for many years – won the 2021 title, after the competition started in India but was moved to the United Arab Emirates because of the Covid situation in India. Besides Du Plessis, De Kock, Jansen and Rossouw, who are almost certainly to be picked up at the auction, several other Proteas stars are in the mix, including Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, David Miller, Aiden Markram, Rassie van der Dussen, Janneman Malan and Keshav Maharaj. Former star spinner Imran Tahir is also hoping to find a team, and so, too, young SA U-19 batting prodigy Dewald Brevis, who caught the attention of the cricketing world with his stunning batting and AB de Villiers-like style at the crease at the recent U-19 World Cup in the West Indies. Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Kagiso Rabada, David Miller, Imran Tahir, Dewald Brevis, Aiden Markram, Marco Jansen, Lungi Ngidi, Tabraiz Shamsi, Rassie van der Dussen, Dwaine Pretorius, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Janneman Malan, Rilee Rossouw, Marchant de Lange, Zubayr Hamza, Ryan Rickelton, Wayne Parnell, Daryn Dupavillon, Sisanda Magala, Nandre Burger, Donavon Ferreira, Gerald Coetzee, Migael Pretorius, Andile Phehlukwayo, Corbin Bosch, Ottniel Baartman, Khwezi Gumede, Duan Jansen, Beyers Swanepoel, Johan van Dyk
