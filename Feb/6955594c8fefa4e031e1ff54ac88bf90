Gallic Chief is engaged for two races at the Vaal racecourse in the space of three days and one would guess trainer Paul Matchett is mainly targeting the first of those – on the Vaal Classic turf on Tuesday. That first task is a MR96 Handicap over 1000m, which might sound like a competitive type of event but which, in fact, is something of a two-horse race between him and Paul Peter-trained Godswood. On Thursday, he’s down for a Progress Plate over 1100m on the main Vaal course, where the opposition is tougher. First things first: Tuesday’s assignment sees Gallic Chief don blinkers for the first time, which looks like a good idea given his history of swerving around in running – and even sometimes trying to nip his rivals. The son of Vercingetorix transferred to the Highveld from KwaZulu-Natal and has enjoyed his new home, delivering a win, a second and a fourth in his three efforts for Matchett. He was ridden on all three occasions by Muzi Yeni, who will know his peccadillos well by now – and probably suggested fitting the scoops. Godswood is a worthy opponent, with a slightly better merit rating. But he has been allotted 62.5kg, which the apprentice rider’s 2.5kg allowance reduces to 60kg, but which is still a chunky 2.5kg more than Gallic Chief will carry. Godswood was blowing after his last start, a return from a short break, and this is his second outing after the holiday. If Gallic Chief wins, he would still be eligible for his Thursday Progress Plate engagement – being a three-time winner. But Matchett might well decide to reward him with a day off.
