It seems as though Mamelodi Sundowns’ approach to SuperSport United when they wanted the services of Teboho Mokoena, was to sweeten the deal by including Bangaly Soumahoro and Sifiso Ngobeni as part of it.ALSO READ: Is Mokoena’s move to Sundowns a step back in his career? The Sundowns duo has since joined SuperSport on loan deals after Mokoena secured a permanent move to the Brazilians. The two defenders will be with Matsatsantsa A Pitori for the remainder of the season. SuperSport coach Kaitano Tembo has been in the market, searching for a competitive left-back to challenge veteran Onismor Bhasera in the position. He is delighted to have landed the services of the 24-year-old Ngobeni. “We brought Sifiso Ngobeni to bring more depth into the team especially in the left back position, currently we only have Onismor Bhasera who recently came from the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon with Zimbabwe, so we really needed cover in that area,” Tembo was quoted as saying on SuperSport’s Twitter page. “The same applies with Bangaly, we have young players like Luke Fleurs, Kegan Johannes, Thatayaone Ditlhokwe who are the first choice centre backs and he will bring some experience to our team especially in defence,” he added. Soumahoro has been struggling for game time at Downs, having made just three appearances across all competitions in the last two seasons.
