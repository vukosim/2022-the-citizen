It is not often that a coach sings an opponent’s praises soon after a loss but Horoya Athletic Club’s Lamine N’diaye was not afraid to hail AmaZulu Fc after they beat his side 1-0 in Durban on Friday.  ALSO READ: Mhango has to fight for place in Pirates line-up, says Davids Usuthu came out of their second Caf Champions League Group B match with the three points at Moses Mabhida Stadium. N’diaye says while they wanted something out of the game, they accepted the result as the better team on the night won. He said South African teams are becoming a force in continental competitions of late.  “South African teams are growing rapidly in this competition. The last time I was here (last year) we lost to Kaizer Chiefs and now we have lost to AmaZulu,” N’diaye said after the game.  “I think that is due to the world class resources that they have here. I am talking about the training facilities, equipment and such things. They are growing every day in this competition.  “Mamelodi Sundowns have already won it (in 2016). Chiefs and Orlando (Pirates) have also reached the final of this competition before,” adds the Senegalese who won the Champions League with TP Mazembe a few years ago.  Just for the record, Pirates have also won the Champions League before, in 1995. “This season South Africa has two teams in the group stages which is also an indication of their growth in this competition,” added N’diaye.  N’diaye said he was disappointed with the result but could not fault his players as they gave it their all. Usuthu scored the winning goal in the 32st minute through Luvuyo Memela. “I am a little disappointed with the mistakes we made, especially at the back which led to the goal. We tried to get back in the game in the second half but we panicked a lot.  “I want to congratulate AmaZulu for winning this game. We wanted to at least get a point out of it which would have been a good result considering that we  are away. Unfortunately that didn’t happen today.”
