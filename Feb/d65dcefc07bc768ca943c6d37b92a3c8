Cheetahs coach Hawies Fourie said he was delighted on Tuesday to be able to welcome back a few key players for their Currie Cup clash with the Bulls in Pretoria. Fourie announced a few changes to the Free State side for the match, to be played at 5.45pm at Loftus Versfeld on Wednesday. Rosko Specman and Siya Masuku were set to return from injury, replacing Craig Barry on the wing and Chris Smit on flyhalf. Andisa Ntsila was handed a starting berth at No 7, with Aidon Davis moving to lock, as a replacement for the injured Rynier Bernardo. Jeandre Rudolph would provide cover on the bench.
