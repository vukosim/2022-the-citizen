Multinational food and drink company Nestle has had to recall some of its KitKat chocolate bars in South Africa over concerns that some of its products may contain glass shards.  KitKat and Nestle issued the voluntary product recall announcement on Thursday evening.  According to reports, the recall comes after a quality inspection found glass shards in some of the inspection samples.  “To date, we have not received any complaints or reported injuries. We are taking this action out of an abundance of caution having discovered the presence of small pieces of glass during our quality and safety checks. “The affected products were produced over a limited period and this voluntary recall covers only products with specific production codes that you can find on the label,” explained the company in a statement. IOL reports that no other sizes and variants of KitKat products (dark chocolate and white chocolate) are affected by this recall.“Consumers who may have purchased the products listed above should not consume them but should instead return them to the place where they were purchased, for a full refund. To locate the production code, consumers should look on the side panel of the package,” said Nestlé South Africa. Consumers who are not sure how to find the production code, or how to return the product can call or WhatsApp 0860096116 or email consumer.services@za.nestle.com to reach Nestlé South Africa.  They can also send their KitKat product recall queries via the brand’s social media platforms.Some social media users saw an opportunity for humour and fired off some jokes using puns related to KitKat’s tagline.Some of the jokes related to the KitKat recall were also quite dark.
