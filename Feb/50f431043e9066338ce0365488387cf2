FAIRVIEW TURF Best Bet: Race 6: Global Drummer (1) to win. With the scratching of Cape Town raiders Wild Coast and Arctic Drift due the reported case of African horse sickness in Gqeberha, local legend Global Drummer should win this comfortably. Value Bet: Race 5: Swinger: Young Nelson (6) x Chauels Camelot (8). Despite the wide draw, Young Nelson must be in with a chance judged on form. Chauels Camelot has had two runs on the Polytrack since moving to Gavin Smith’s yard. Now on the turf he could spring a surprise.
