Sharks and Springbok wing Makazole Mapimpi has been named South Africa’s United Rugby Championship Player of the Month for January. A panel of South African rugby media singled out Mapimpi for not only his four tries in two matches in January – including a hat-trick against the Lions – but also his general work rate and “anticipation and creativity on attack and his tenacity on defence – whether through his tackling or claiming the high ball”. The media were unanimous in their praise of Mapimpi’s performances, which they agree makes him the pre-eminent winger in world rugby at present. “Makazole Mapimpi has underlined his standing as one of the premier wings in world rugby.  “His ability to combine with Lukhanyo Am in particular gives the Sharks a different dynamic with ball-in-hand. It’s not hard to see why he is regarded as one the best finishers in world rugby at the moment.  “Mapimpi is at the top of his game. He’s world class and in a league of his own.”
