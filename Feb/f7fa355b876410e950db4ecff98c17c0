To ensure that dust is kept away from the surfaces of your home, you can use a homemade mixture made from ingredients that can be found in your kitchen.  Caroline mixes half a teaspoon of olive oil, one teaspoon of vinegar, half a cup of water, two drops of fish soap, and ten drops of coconut oil into a glass cup. She then uses that mixture to wipe over her surfaces in her house to get rid of any dust, and to ensure that the dust stays away for a much longer period.

Expired pillows can cause many neck and back problems.  Caroline has shared a hack on how to check if your pillows are still in a good condition, or if they have expired.  She simply suggests folding your pillows in half, and then holding them in that position for about 30 seconds. If the pillow springs back once you let it go, then it is still in a good condition. If the pillow takes longer to get back to its normal flat state, then it is time for a new pillow.
