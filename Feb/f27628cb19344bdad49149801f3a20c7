SCOTTSVILLE BEST BET Race 3 Swinger 9-Run Again and 10 Noble Storm From at Scottsville is very much in the favour of runners and these two both have proven form at the course. Noble Storm is the runner to beat and does hold Run Again on their last run. But that was only Run Again’s second outing and there could be some improvement so the Swinger does look the safer best.  VALUE BET Race 5 Quartet – double float 1-Napolean and 2-Triton with the field There are only nine runners in this field but it does look quite open and one is capable of getting an upset result. The full bet will cost R504 but 10% will cost R50.40 while one can also take 5% for R25.20.
