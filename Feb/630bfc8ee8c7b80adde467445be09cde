Budget 2022 also shows where your tax money goes and the good news is that there will indeed be more money for law enforcement, supporting vulnerable households and teachers. Minister of Finance Enoch Godongwana said as we face steep and daunting challenges, we will overcome and to do so, we need to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoods, while supporting inclusive growth.  “This budget presents this balance,” he said. Tax collections have been much stronger than expected, with tax revenue for 2021/22 estimated to be R1.55 trillion, R62 billion higher than estimates from four months ago. However, he pointed out that although the fiscal outlook has improved, there are significant risks to the fiscal framework that include slowing global and domestic economic growth, calls for a permanent increase in social protection that exceed available resources, pressures from the public service wage bill and continued requests for financial support from financially distressed state‐owned entities (SOEs).
