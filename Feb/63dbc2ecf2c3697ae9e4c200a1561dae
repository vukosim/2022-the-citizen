The South African National Road Agency Limited (Sanral) announced that it will make adjustments to the annual toll tariffs from 1 March 2022.  The new tariffs will increase by 5%, and it is reported the increase in tariffs is determined by the consumer price index (CPI). Toll routes to be affected include the N1, N2, N3, N4, and N17.  Vehicle clauses at conventional toll plazas are determined by the number of axles. Class 1 refers to all light vehicles. If you drive a medium-heavy vehicle with two axles, you fall under Class 2. Class 3 consists of large heavy vehicles with three or four axles, and Class 4 vehicles are extra heavy vehicles with five or more axles.
