SuperSport TV pundit Farouk Khan summed up Cape Town City’s DStv Premiership goalless draw with Kaizer Chiefs at the Cape Town Stadium on Tuesday evening perfectly when he said it was all fire, but no fire. ALSO READ: What Chiefs need to do to get a win against City Both sides tried their best to get out of first gear, but just could not and the game bordered on boredom for the most part. It was one of those games where both sides needed to get initial anxiety out of the way, after they suffered deflating defeats in the Nedbank Cup last weekend. It was easy to see that both teams were apprehensive in the early exchanges. Chiefs settled earlier and started to string together decent passes and create forward movements. But they still lacked that bite and looked disjointed at times. While they persistently attacked, they didn’t really test City ‘keeper Hugo Marques with any threatening shots at goal. City also had some promising moments but were mostly forced into long range efforts which didn’t really trouble Chiefs’ Brandon Petersen. Just over 10 minutes into the second half, Chiefs head coach Stuart Baxter realised that they lacked aggression up front and sent on Samir Nurkovic in Bernard Parker’s place to try and put the City defence under some pressure. With a point of reference up front, Chiefs started getting into the City box more often but they still could not find the right final passes. City also introduced Khanyisa Mayo who looked determined to find a goal, taking a few shots, but nothing came off those.
