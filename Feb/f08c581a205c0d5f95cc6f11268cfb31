As their platform continues to grow, Netflix has invested heavily in their content, amassing so much of it that they will be able to release new movies every week this year.“Need ideas for your next movie night? Netflix has you covered: whether you’re looking for a laugh, cry, scream or cheer, we’ve got an A-list cast for any mood with new movies every week all year,” teased the streaming platform in a new announcement earlier this week.  Stars such as Ryan Gosling, Chris Evans, Halle Berry, Daniel Craig, Millie Bobby Brown and Henry Cavill will all star in some of the major films slated to go live on the platform sometime this year.  “Take in a double feature with Adam Sandler and Jamie Foxx or crack up with comedic duos Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy, Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg, and a stop-motion reunion with Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key.” The streaming platform will also drop films the whole family can enjoy starring the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldaña, Jason Momoa, Charlize Theron and Kerry Washington.  Among these films include Netflix’s rendition of Roald Dahl’s Matilda starring Lashana Lynch and Emma Thompson. It won’t only be acting talent on full display, as Netflix has also put a lot of thought into filmmakers on their slate.  This includes the likes of Judd Apatow, Noah Baumbach, Edward Berger, Niki Caro, Scott Cooper, Guillermo del Toro, Sally El Hosaini, Kim Farrant, Paul Feig, John Lee Hancock, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Louis Leterrier, Shawn Levy, Tobias Lindholm, Richard Linklater, Tyler Perry, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo, Nora Twomey, and George C.
