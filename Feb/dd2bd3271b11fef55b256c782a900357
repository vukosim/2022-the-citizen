Cape trainer Andre Nel’s satellite yard in KwaZulu-Natal is in top form and could augment the stats with a good day at Greyville on Wednesday, when racing is on the Polytrack. Nel fields three runners – in two races – and a couple of wins is not out of the question. The horses in question are Run To Denmark in the third and Port Adelaide in the fourth. So far this season, the Nel team has had 13 winners from 64 runners on the Greyville Poly – a strike rate of 20%, not to mention a first-three ratio of 42%. In the last 28 days, they’ve posted a 30% win rate in KZN as a whole. That’s some going for a “second string”, far away from the trainer’s main locus of attention in Cape Town. Grey gelding Run To Denmark is a wonderfully consistent performer and clearly loves the soft surface at Greyville. He has almost never been out of the money in 14 visits to this venue and has posted three of his four career wins here. Last time out, he trotted up over course and distance despite losing a shoe in running. The principal opposition in the MR83 Handicap over 2000m will come from Gareth van Zyl-trained Mystery Boy and Alyson Wright’s Ibutho, but backers of Run To Denmark won’t lose for lack of heart from their choice. Port Adelaide in the following race, a FM Handicap over 1600m, might be the stable’s best hope for the day – if only marginally. This Australian-bred filly broke her maiden in mid-November – in her ninth start and third after relocating from the Southern Tip. She followed up with a feisty third in her handicap debut, so clearly has what it takes one step up. She drops from the 1900m of her success, to 1600m, but likes a bit of zip in the gallop and will have no problems. Plus, she has leading jockey and Greyville old-hand Warren Kennedy to help her along. Nel and his sole patron Plattner Racing also have Dancing Sword in the fourth – a talented mare who has had her health issues. She, too, has taken to the Polytrack with relish and, if she can put it all together and stay out of trouble, could spring a surprise.
