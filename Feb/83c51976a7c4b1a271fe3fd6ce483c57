According to a statement issued late Monday by the Lions, the brothers are unable to travel with their team-mates because of “unforeseen circumstances relating to their travel document requirements.” ALSO READ:  Lions’ one-off tour match against Leinster: Four reasons to be worried The match against Leinster is scheduled for Friday at the RDS Arena.
