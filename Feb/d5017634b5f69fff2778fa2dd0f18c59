Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler hardly speaks about his playing days since becoming a coach.

He has played for the Cameroon Under-20 national team,” says Tinkler of his new player.  “He plays in my position, or what used to be my position and I think he is a highly talented player and will be a massive addition to our team.  “We are happy to have him. His defensive qualities as a holding midfielder are exceptional, he shows good aggression in terms of wanting to win the ball but when on the ball he is technically good. He is comfortable and never panics and is good on diagonal balls.”  With club veteran Thabo Nodada believed to be in his last days at the Citizens, Ambina is seen as a possible replacement for him in Tinkler’s team.  City have also meanwhile added an attacking midfielder Kajally Drammek  who comes in after the departure of Bradley Ralani who has joined Mamelodi Sundowns.  “Kajally is a young attacking player whom we scouted in Gambia and we have been chasing since the start of the season. But we only managed now to conclude the deal.  “We have been monitoring him every week playing in the Gambian league. He is 18-years-old but shows a level of maturity that he is more than capable of playing at the highest level,” said Tinkler.  “There was European interest in him and I think we snapped up a talented player before he made that move. He is very creative and an intelligent footballer, he can play wide and as a No. 10 so he is someone who has a bright future.”
