Reeve Frosler has been with Kaizer Chiefs for almost three years now, but he has yet to taste any kind of success with the Naturena side.ALSO READ: Will Khune start in goals for Chiefs in Nedbank Cup tie against Galaxy?In his first season at Amakhosi, Frosler came close to hitting the big time as his team nearly won the DStv Premiership title but were pipped to the post by Mamelodi Sundowns right at the finish line.Going into their last game of the season, Amakhosi needed to win against Baroka to take the trophy but a draw on the day put paid to their chances.Yet not all is lost – at least for Frosler, who recently recommitted himself to the side by penning a new three-year deal with Amakhosi.“It’s almost exactly three years since I joined the club,” Frosler told the club website recently. “It’s been a good three years. I am happy to have renewed my contract and to continue to be part of this big institution,” added the 24-year-old.Amakhosi begin their Nedbank Cup campaign with a tricky fixture against TS Galaxy on Saturday. Galaxy are the same side who shamed Amakhosi when they beat them in the final of the same competition back in 2019.“Things will start getting better and we are hoping to start winning trophies. We’ve got TS Galaxy in the Nedbank Cup, and we have the potential to go all the way. We will take it one game at a time and try to do our best,” said Frosler of their prospects in Ke Yona.Amakhosi spent a few weeks in Cape Town last month reviving themselves and getting ready to resume their season.Frosler feels this was what they needed ahead of a busy schedule. “I enjoyed the mid- season break and being away from Johannesburg. A lot of guys needed a break,” he said.“It was a nice break for us and we have come back fresh with a good mindset to kickstart the second half of the season.“Hopefully, we continue from where we left off and continue to do well for the rest of the season.”
