Just when we thought Royal AM chairperson Andile Mpisane’s Valentine’s Day couldn’t possibly get any more interesting, his ex and baby mama Sithelo Shozi dropped some smoking Valentine’s Day content on Instagram. South Africans were left speechless in December when their social media timelines were flooded with pictures and a romantic video of Andile proposing to 25-year-old social media influencer, model and content creator, Tamia Louw. The proposal and wedding followed mere months after the birth of Andile’s second child with Sithelo in May. Speculation has been rife that Andile and Tamia’s hasty marriage was the result of her being pregnant. Tamia finally confirmed these rumours on Sunday, announcing her pregnancy on her personal Instagram account.

Fans and celebrities, including the likes of Thuli Phongolo and South African actress Zola Nombona, Ayanda Thabethe and musician and Real Housewifes of Durban Season 2’s Londie London, took to the comments section to show their love to Shozi. She didn’t stop there, however. On Monday afternoon, Sithelo also dropped a saucy video clip of her wearing sexy black lingerie, smiling, drinking champagne and eating a cake that says “F*ck love”. “Let ‘em eat cake” (with a black heart emoji) is all she captioned her post with. We couldn’t help but wonder if this was a stab at Andile and Tamia after their pregnancy announcement on Sunday. Some of the comments on the video also reflected our thoughts. “You need to date, marry or have a baby with @kwa_mammkhize ex-husband…just nje. Make it checkmate. Hit 2 birds with one stone,” commented laila.lukhe.
