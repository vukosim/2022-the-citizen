For rapper Cassper Nyovest, creating and leaving a legacy for his son Khotso Izwe Simba Phoolo is everything.  The musician welcomed his first child with his partner Thobeka Majozi in September 2020. The parents have shared a couple of pics of Khotso but have intentionally not shown his face.  On Thursday, Cassper posted an adorable picture of himself and Khotso striking a pose on the staircase. Khotso is wearing a cute striped beige overall with blue shoes.

During his interview on Power FM with Aldrin Sampear in 2020, he said he won’t shy away from spoiling Khotso but won’t rise a “brat.” “My son is going to have a lit life. I was talking to Bonang Matheba this one time and she was like ‘I can’t wait to spoil him rotten’. I was like, man, my son is going to have an aunt like Bonang. This kid is going to grow up with so much love, opportunity, and privilege. “My role is to teach him humility, I don’t want him thinking he’s better than anybody. I would like to raise a very humble kid, I don’t want to raise a spoilt kid. That would be such a failure to me if that happens,” he said.  If he is not on daddy duties, performing or promoting his business deals, Cassper’s latest passion is boxing. The artist has grabbed the public’s attention with celebrity boxing matches, organised by him in the past few months. After easily taking down podcaster Slik Talk, Cassper Nyovest’s next fight is against actor and DJ Naak MusiQ. The match is set to take place between 8 and 11 April at Sun City.
