Orlando Pirates coach Mandla Ncikazi says his squad looks much better than it was last year, following a number of players returning from injuries.ALSO READ: Pirates coach Ncikazi would have liked to make January signings, but…But there are still some concerns for Pirates ahead of their Nedbank Cup last 32 round tie against AmaZulu FC at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday. The Buccaneers begin the year with winger Vincent Pule still out due to injury which he sustained while on national duty with Bafana Bafana in October last year. Pule was expected to be out for not over three months, and despite the club saying he is making good progress in recovering, it seems like Ncikazi and the rest of the Bucs technical team don’t want to rush the skilful winger back into the team, while Thembinkosi Lorch and Zakhele Lepasa’s are not yet back to their best. “Still, I haven’t had an opportunity of having the full team but it’s better than what it was before. Pule is still out, Lepasa is back but not at his best yet, Lorch, the same.” “I hoped this period would give us an opportunity but there was the DStv Compact Cup, there is also the pandemic that is engulfing the whole country. So it is better than what it was before and hopefully we can be at full strength soon and Pirates can start playing with their best team without disrespecting other players that have been playing.” AmaZulu have given Pirates a tough time in their last few games despite the Soweto giants having better head to head stats. In their last five meetings, Pirates have won three, while the other two fixtures were drawn. With concerns over fitness of  some of the players, Ncikazi will be pinning his hope on striker Gabadinho Mhango to bring his sterling Africa Cup of Nations performances back to the team ahead of the Ke Yona Cup. At the tournament held in Cameroon, the striker scored three goals for Malawi, but they were unfortunately knocked out of the last 16 round.
