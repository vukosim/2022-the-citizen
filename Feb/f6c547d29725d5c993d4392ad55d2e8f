It is said that club owner Shauwn Mkhize saw the departed players as surplus and that they were wasting money on them, hence they decided to let them go. “There is no way that the club is struggling with money my brother, there is no way. There is a lot of money at this club, I mean, as if people have seen it,” said a source. “It is just that the management needed to get rid of some of the players who were really not playing. You have to remember that when they bought the status, there were players from Bloemfontein Celtic and the ones from the club. “There were about 50 players who had contracts and that alone says there is going to be a lot of money coming out while some of these guys are only training and not playing. So, that is why the management decided to terminate their contracts. It’s not really about struggling with money it is all about cutting wasteful expenditure. “If you look at it, there are new players who have bought recently, so, how does a club that is struggling with money be able to buy new players?”
