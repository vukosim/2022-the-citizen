South African World Cup winner Eben Etzebeth could give last-place Toulon a lift by making his first Top 14 appearance of the season as they host Bordeaux-Begles on Saturday. The lock started the season with South Africa in the southern hemisphere Rugby Championship and then played in the autumn internationals in November.  In the last match of the tour, a one-point loss to England at Twickenham, Etzebeth suffered his third concussion of the year. Just as he ended five months away from Toulon, Etzebeth was ruled out for three months. The 30-year-old is poised to return on Saturday for a match originally scheduled in December but postponed because of Covid. Bordeaux-Begles are five points clear at the top of the Top 14 table.  Three-time European champions Toulon are last, but their Covid problems mean they have played fewer games than any other club. They are a point behind Biarritz, but with three games in hand. Etzebeth might not be the only international veteran returning to the pack. Italian Sergio Parisse could also make his return after a wrist injury.
