We are working hard preparing for the next match and I think we are now ready,” he says. While he is back to full training Nurkovic says he is not yet at his best and there is still some hard work he needs to put in.  “I am still working to get into the best possible shape, where I used to be. It requires a lot of work but it should be there soon.  “It was painful watching all these games from the sidelines and on TV. I have missed the supporters on the stands, I can’t wait to be back to have our faithful Amakhosi family back on the stands and then everything will be alright.”
