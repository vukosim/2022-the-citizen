If you watched the first half of Mamelodi Sundowns’ second Caf Champions League Group A game and could not come back for the second, you’d be forgiven for thinking the Tshwane giants would score an easy win.  This is after Masandawana gave a starring performance in the first half of their game against Sudan’s El Merreikh at Al Salam Stadium in Cairo, Egypt on Saturday afternoon.  Sundowns were quick out of the blocks and could have gone 2-0 up within the first 10 minutes but lacked sharpness up front. In fact, Sundowns did have the ball in the net but Erwin Saavedra was in an offside position before playing the ball for Peter Shalulile.  As the game progressed, El Merreikh found their footing and found space behind the Masandawana defence.  They should have taken the lead in the 26th minute but were denied by Brian Onyango who saved the ball on the line with his namesake Denis already beaten. With just over 35 minutes played Sundowns were forced into a change whenSaavedra had to be taken off with an injury. This was after a collision with El Merreikh defender Mohammed Mustafa. Thabiso Kutumela took his place. Tony Edjomariegwe was unlucky to see his effort sail just wide and off target with Onyango beaten on the stroke of half-time.  El Merreikh came out a better team for the second half and didn’t give Sundowns the freedom on the ball that they enjoyed in the first. Edjomariegwe had the ball in the back of the net in the 59th minute with a solid strike taken inside the Sundowns box but he was flagged offside and the goal didn’t count. Sundowns survived a nervy ending with El Merreikh throwing everything at them in the closing stages.  The draw is a good result for Sundowns who are still top of the group with four points. Al Ahly, El Merreikh and Al Hilal are all behind them with one point each. Al Ahly and El Merreikh do, however, have a game in hand.  Sundowns’ next game is on Friday, also in Cairo,against their former coach Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly.
