Former Springbok and Lions flyer Aphiwe Dyantyi made his first hint at a return to rugby on Monday when he released a statement on his Instagram account suggesting he would make a sensational return to the game when his doping ban comes to an end next year. In 2019, after a national training camp ahead of leaving for the World Cup, Dyantyi’s B samples from mandatory testing came back positive for banned substances, which saw him suspended from playing. A lengthy process then finally came to an end in December 2020 when the South African Institute for Drug Free Sport handed down a four year ban for his doping offence, despite Dyantyi maintaining his innocence throughout the process. He is thus unable to return to professional or semi-professional rugby until 12 August 2023, only two weeks before he will turn 29-years-old. In his widely shared post Dyantyi said: “This year marks three years out of the game. A very challenging three years coupled with tears, rebuilding, love and laughter. “A trial and error period in my life, but two business projects down the line, I wouldn’t change anything about my life journey. The support has been both heartwarming and humbling (Thank You). “I find myself in a privileged position of building beyond rugby and focusing on getting back on the field, and get back I will … “I’m only getting started …” Once Dyantyi has served his ban he will have every right to return to the rugby field. He was once one of the country’s most exciting young rising talents and was even named World Rugby’s Breakthrough Player of the Year in 2018. It remains to be seen if he will ever be able to reach those heights again, or if he will even be able to get himself back into the Springbok fold, but seeing him back in action will be a sight to behold.
