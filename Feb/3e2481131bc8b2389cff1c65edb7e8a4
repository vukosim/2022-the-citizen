David Rachidi, who is the Betway South Africa marketing manager, says this is one of their ways of contributing to sports development in communities.  “We are proud to have rolled out a highly successful edition of the #BetwayCares Skills Hub in 2021, which afforded aspiring coaches, referees and administrators a platform to enhance their knowledge and skills. While coaching, officiating and administration courses remain a critical need across the country, we have also taken note of the crucial role that sports medicine would play in adding to the existing knowledge that community sport leaders possess,” said Rachidi. “The role of sports science and medicine in the modern game continues to be on the rise and as an innovative and caring brand, we see it fit that we introduce our communities to such knowledge as early as possible, which is critical across all levels of sport,” he concluded. Soweto LFA president Phil Mogodi believes such a workshop will play a huge role for their region and coaches will now understand the basics of sports medicine. “The SAFA Soweto Local Football Association is honoured to be partnering with Betway, who have demonstrated their passion and commitment in lending a helping hand towards the growth of sports in communities. Having such a workshop will certainly add value to football development in our region, as coaches will now approach their roles with an added advantage of understanding the basics of sports medicine,” said Mogodi
