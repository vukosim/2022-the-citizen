Gather is a curated local grocery concept store that has local producers of quality artisan food products and fresh organic vegetables.  The intention is to create a grocery store collective that changes the shopping experience by giving the expert crafters of food products the ability to reach customers in a considered, immersive and curated way in a convenient location.

Hundreds of hours went into the forethought, the systems, the brand acquisition, the visual language and most importantly, the business model.  “We are proud of its complexity and solid foundation,” says Gather’s curator and owner of The Grainery, Twila Cannell. The brands which have come on board, including Amma’s Creamery and Razia’s Pickle, are special brands. They are a true celebration and testament to the tenacity and creativity of the South African food entrepreneur. You’ll find the Gather store at the first SOKO District, located in Rosebank Mall, 50 Bath Ave, Rosebank.
