Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis says she would have loved to play a North African country in their preparation for their final round of the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Algeria on 18 February at home. But, because of Covid restrictions in other countries, Ellis says they could only get Zambia to prepare them for the qualifiers, with the senior national women’s team set to lock horns with the Copper Queens of Zambia in Lusaka on Saturday.

And Zambia having gone to the Olympics they have done extremely well. We have played each other on a few occasions and the games have been very tight between us. When we wanted a friendly it was no brainer, we would have loved to play a North African opposition of course, because we are playing a North African team. But we all know the challenges of Covid-19. But this will not only help us, it will also help Zambia because they are preparing for a game against Namibia. “We know when we play it is not just a friendly, it’s a very competitive match, it’s a friendly, but you still want to win the match. But, Zambia are a very fantastic team and I foresee a very tough encounter.” Banyana jetted off to Zambia on Thursday, with the team having been together for almost a week. But, only locally based players have been called up for this friendly match with only Hilda Magaia, who is based in Sweden playing for Moron BK the only overseas player since she is yet to get back to her club.
