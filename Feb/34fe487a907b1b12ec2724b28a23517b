Cricket South Africa (CSA) on Friday announced the 15-player squad that will represent South Africa during the 2022 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup taking place in New Zealand between 4 March and 3 April. The team will lead by captain Suné Luus during the 12th edition of the 50-over global event, with all-rounder Chloé Tryon continuing the vice-captaincy role in an exciting squad that also sees the return of opening batter, Lizelle Lee after she missed the ongoing West Indies series. Regular captain Dane van Niekerk is out with an injury. The traveling reserves form part of the ICC’s medical protocols and will travel together with the rest of the squad. South Africa were one of four nations, along with Australia, England and India who qualified for the competition based on their standings in the ICC Women’s Championship between 2017 and 2020, with head coach, Hilton Moreeng’s charges currently ranked second in the ICC One-Day International (ODI) rankings. The eight-team tournament will kick off with a group stage round, where all teams player each other once before the top four sides compete in the semi-finals and finals. South Africa will get their journey underway in Dunedin against Bangladesh on Saturday, 5 March, before moving onto Tauranga, Hamilton, and Wellington, and then wrapping up the round-robin stage with a clash against India in Christchurch on Sunday, 27 March. Another crucial period for the ladies will be the enthralling back-to-back matches against England, hosts New Zealand and Australia on 14, 17 and 22 March.
