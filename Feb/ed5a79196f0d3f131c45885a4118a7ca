Gaston Sirino will miss a chance to face one of his favourite sides on the continent, Al-Ahly, after he suffered a nasal fracture in a Caf Champions League game against Al-Hilal last Friday.ALSO READ: Al Ahly give update on Pitso Mosimane’s contract situationIt is no secret that Sirino has always wanted to play for the Egyptian giants, having tried to force a move away from Chloorkop.Downs will meet Pitso Mosimane’s Al Ahly side on 25 February and during that time, Sirino will still be nursing his broken nose.“I am sad because he was really coming back strong and showing good signs, even in training and now we have to lose him in the manner that we did. Fortunately he has already had an operation, and the doctors have predicted that he could be out for two to three weeks.“We are hoping that maybe when we come back from Al-Ahly he might be in a good space to assist the team going forward. We wish him a speedy recovery because he is a very important member of our team,” said his co-head coach Manqoba Mngqithi.The Masandawana mentor was delighted to see his side hold off a strong fight from Al-Hilal last week as they defeated the Sudanese giants by a single goal to nil.Mngqithi says everyone who takes Tha Blue Wave lightly should think again, as he tips them to be the kingmakers of Group A.“Many people are looking at Al-Hilal as any other team but this is the biggest team in Sudan and they are a team that is always in this stage of the competition and sometimes in the quarterfinals or semifinals, so they are no pushovers. It is a team that might still help us within this group by making sure that they beat other teams that might pose a problem to us,” said Mngqithi.“The truth of the matter is that it won’t be easy for any team in this group…mark my words,” warned Mngqithi.
