A seven-time winner on the dirt in Hong Kong – including last start – Will Power has competed on the grass only four times but has done so for two placings – once bravely missing by a neck at Happy Valley over 1200m in Class 2. “I’ve always thought he would handle the turf and he’s run very well at Happy Valley previ- ously. “He’s been unlucky a few times and he’s only once been over 1400m – that day he was ridden a little bit upside down and at the moment he’s in no man’s land with his rating – there’s not many options, so it’s the perfect race to give him an- other shot,” Whyte said.

Will Power – on 109 – is the highest rated horse in this lucrative contest. “He’s probably in as good form – if not slightly better than his last race, so he’s in a rich vein of form at the moment and if he gets a nice run then he should be giving a good account of himself,” Whyte said.Blake Shinn takes the reins aboard Will Power   and   the pair steps away from gate No 7 against the likes of Lucky Express, Buddies, Californiadeep- shot, Winning Dreamer, Master Montaro and Cheerful Days. – HKJC
