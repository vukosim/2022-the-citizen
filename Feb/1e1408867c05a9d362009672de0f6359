TURFFONTEIN INSIDE TRACK BEST BET RACE 3 SWINGER 4-EMIRATE GINA AND 6-MISS COOL Emirate Gina has run three times for three places while Miss Cool has run twice, finishing fifth on debut and then a close one-length fourth in her next start. These two should fight out the finish. VALUE BET RACE 8 NO 7 TALLINN – EACHWAY Mike de Kock’s runner ran a cracker last time when she was dropped back to 1200m at this course and was beaten just 0.70 lengths by Sabina Fairchild last Saturday. She was drawn No 9 out of 10 runners on a track where inside draws are vital. Today she is drawn in pole position and should go very close.
