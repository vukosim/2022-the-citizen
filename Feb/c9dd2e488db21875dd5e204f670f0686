AmaZulu FC captain Makhehleni Makhaula is confident his side can come back with a positive result for their first Caf Champions League Group B match away at Raja Casablanca. Usuthu begin their group stages journey on Saturday night with the game in Morocco set for a 9 pm start. Makhaula was full of confidence when he spoke to the media ahead of the game on Friday. “It’s going to be a very difficult game. But we have prepared well,” said the former Free State Stars man. “The coaches have told us what to expect and the things we need to do on the field.  “At the end of the day it is up to us as players, and whatever the coaches have imparted to us during training, if we apply it well I think it is going to be us who beat ourselves. If we really want it, anything is possible.” READ ALSO: Sundowns kickoff CAFCL with a narrow win over Al Hilal Usuthu have some experienced campaigners in Caf competitions in their side with both Philani Zulu and Kgotso Moleko having been with Kaizer Chiefs when they reached the final last year. They have also recently acquired Abubaker Mobara who was with Orlando Pirates when they reached the final in the Caf Confederation Cup a few years ago.  Makhaula says they are playing a role in settling the nerves and guiding them through their journey.  “It is a dream come true for us to play in this competition. Others (in the team) have been there before and they have the experience and they are helping us on how to field the pressure here. We are going to fight, we are going to fight with everything that we have.”
