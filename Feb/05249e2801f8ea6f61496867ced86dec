The supposed tension between AmaZulu’s top brass and their head coach Benni McCarthy is understood to have subsided as the two have smoked the peace pipe and are ready to “make Usuthu great”.

At the end of the day the point is to make Usuthu great,” the source added.Players reckon Sithebe has made a bold moveMeanwhile, a few players in the AmaZulu FC camp are said to be unsettled and wishing they could do what Siyethemba Sithebe has done – join another club. At the centre of the unhappiness is said to be McCarthy’s treatment of the players, especially the older ones. “I heard one of the senior players congratulate Sithebe and say he was lucky to finally be out of that place, even thought he still has six months to serve at the club. A lot of players in that team would jump at a chance to move away from the club at the moment. They are not happy with how Benni is treating them, and what’s worse worse is that he was a player himself not so long ago and should know how it feels,” said a source. McCarthy has on numerous occasions publicly blasted his players when things didn’t go his way.
