GREYVILLE POLYTRACK BEST BET RACE 6: SWINGER: 2 HER ROYAL MAJESTY AND 4 ARIANOS SPINNER This is a very tricky card but these two horses have good form over the course and distance and should both run into the money. VALUE BET RACE 7 NO 4 KUUMA – EACHWAY Sean Tarry takes this runner to Durban to race on the Polytrack, the course where he won his maiden. He has not been in the best of form of late but was running against stronger. In addition, his merit rating is coming down markedly which means he can take on weaker rivals off lower weights. Tarry has engaged log-leading jockey Warren Kennedy to ride the gelding and that is another positive. He is 8-1 in early betting and that could be great value.
