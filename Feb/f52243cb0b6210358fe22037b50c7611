St George’s Park was the principality of South Africa’s Prince of Leg-Spin, Shaun von Berg, on Tuesday as he consigned the Central Gauteng Lions to defeat against the Boland Rocks in their CSA T20 Challenge match. Von Berg took a devastating 3/14 in his four overs as the Lions, chasing 161 to win, were bowled out for 116 in just 17.2 overs. Although Joshua Richards was trapped lbw to the first ball of the innings from left-arm spinner Siyabonga Mahima, the Lions were well-placed on 46/1 after six overs as Reeza Hendricks and Shane Dadswell added 46 off 38 balls. But Dadswell (29) was bowled by Von Berg’s first ball, mowing across the line, and the seasoned spinner had Mitchell van Buuren caught behind next delivery with a classic leg-break. Once Mahima (4-0-20-2) removed Reeza Hendricks for a determined 46 off 39 balls, the Lions were 94/6 and Hardus Viljoen and Ferisco Adams, who both also took two wickets in two balls, ran through the rest of the batting line-up. Captain Pieter Malan was largely responsible for leading Boland to 160/4 after they had been sent in to bat, compiling a steely 71 off 48 deliveries. Adams (30* off 23) and Christiaan Jonker (20 off 15) provided a good finish to the innings as Boland had enough on the board to be rewarded with an invaluable bonus point. In the afternoon game, the rampant Western Province side roared to an 84-run win over the North-West Dragons, their fourth consecutive triumph also earning them a bonus point. Chasing 165, Beuran Hendricks ran through the North-West top-order with superb figures of 4-20, the joint best in the competition so far. With leg-spinner Junaid Dawood claiming 3/22 in his four overs, North-West were shot out for just 80. Captain Wayne Parnell took 1/13 in three overs with the ball and two fine catches, one of them a full-length diving effort to remove the dangerous Delano Potgieter off Hendricks. The left-hander had earlier struck a ferocious 33 not out off just 17 balls to lift Western Province to 164/8, after an incredible collapse in which they lost six wickets for 25 runs left them on 134/8 with just two overs remaining. The collapse was largely caused by brilliant left-arm spin from Senuran Muthusamy, who also took 4/20, and came after a solid platform had been laid by Jonathan Bird (53 off 44) and Dane Vilas (31 off 20).
