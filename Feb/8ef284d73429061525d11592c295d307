Kaitano  Tembo was not happy at all with his team’s defence when they lost 2-1 to Maritzburg United in the DStv Premiership on Tuesday night. It was the Team of Choice’s first win in 11 games and Tembo is quite disappointed that it came at SuperSport United’s expense.

I think we were a bit better in the second half, we were quicker in our reaction but it was not enough to win the game,” said the Matsatsantsa A Pitori mentor, before adding that a couple of his players had an off day, including Jesse Donn, wo netted his fifth goal in SuperSport colours.“I am happy for him but I think he will be the first one to agree that he did not play well but it is a process, we have a very young team and we will continue encouraging and building them up. We have to start building for the future and that is why we brought in the young Thapelo Maseko for his debut and we have to take it that route.“It was just unfortunate for Thapelo to come in a game like this, but in the process of learning, he will get better. I could see that he was a little bit caught up in the moment, did not really touch the ball, but we will try and build him because I think he has talent and he will get better,” Tembo added.He introduced newly recruited Sifiso Ngobeni in the later stages of the match, replacing Onismor Bhasera, in the hope that the younger and more energetic Ngobeni would run up and down the flank, but that was not to be.  “I wanted Sifiso to a little bit high up because we were chasing the game and technically he is better because he is more of an attacking full-back, so I wanted him to attack because at that moment we were a goal down and we wanted to try and get back into the game and he did not do that, by with time I think he will be okay,” said Tembo.SuperSport’s next league game is later this month where they will host Royal AM.
