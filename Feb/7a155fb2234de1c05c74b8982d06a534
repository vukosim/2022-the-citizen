He joins a special South African envoy in Egypt with coach Pitso Mosimane, fitness trainer Kabelo Ragoaga, analyst Musi Matlaba and Percy Tau who are with Al Ahly.  Roger De Sa is also employed in Egypt as an assistant to national team coach Carlos Quiroz.   Welcoming him to the club, Pyramids said they were happy with their new acquisition and were looking forward to seeing him flex his muscles at their home venue, the June 30 Stadium.  At 24, Lakay is a well rounded and experienced campaigner having made his debut at Santos as a teenager before breaking into Bafana Bafan at only 17.  He has also plied his trade at SuperSport United before joining City a few seasons back.  And in 26-year-old Gonzalez, City seem to have found a capable replacement judging by his statistics. It however remains to be seen how quickly he will adjust to the local game.  City also released Abubaker Mobara to AmaZulu who were looking to strengthen their team in preparation for their Caf Champions League run.
