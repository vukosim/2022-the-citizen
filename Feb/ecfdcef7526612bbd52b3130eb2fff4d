Actress, producer and businesswoman Connie Ferguson has been triggered by a video gone viral that was shared by a so-called prophet. The video was shared by a prophet on social media, claiming that Connie was in danger of getting cancer.  The producer took to Twitter after viewing the clip to share that she was triggered by the video and the message which the prophet had for her.  Ferguson’s eldest daughter, Lesedi Matsunyane-Ferguson, also took to social media to express how distasteful the video was. She accused the prophet of attacking her mother and using the Ferguson family to gain clout. “Ohhh we pay attention to God, alright; and for a ‘Man of God’ you have very malicious intentions by using my family as clickbait. If your heart is as pure as what your calling REQUIRES you to be, you’d have found any other way to deliver whatever message directly. “Salacious at best. I don’t care that we’re public figures, have some kind of basic decency & decorum. We have a lot to move forward from, as is,” said Lesedi in a tweet.
