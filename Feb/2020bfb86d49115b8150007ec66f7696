Western Province are geared up and ready for a tough battle against Griquas in their Currie Cup match in Kimberley on Friday night. Both teams are gunning for their second wins of the tournament, but they head into the game off differing results, with Western Province looking to bounce back from two defeats in a row, while Griquas are aiming to build on their first win of the competition. Griquas are fourth on the log while Western Province sit seventh, but both teams are on the same amount of points, meaning the winner will begin to pull away and make a move up the table. “It is always tough going up to Kimberley to face the Griquas. For them it’s like playing against a Super Rugby team, which is a big thing for them,” said Western Province assistant coach Nazeem Adams. “If my memory serves me right, last year we lost against them home and away in both Currie Cup games. So we are looking forward to the match but we are under no illusions that it is going to be really tough up there.” ALSO READ: Eben Etzebeth to join Sharks on long-term deal Lock David Meihuizen recently returned to the Western Province and Stormers mix after injury and is looking forward to continuing his comeback this weekend. He believes the visitors are fully prepared for the challenge as they have received help from the Stormers URC team in the build-up to the game. “It’s been interesting but really nice. Both squads are working well together,” said Meihuizen. “Last week the Currie Cup had a bye so we helped out with the Stormers preparation for their match against the Lions, and this week with the URC bye the Stormers are helping us out with our prep for the Griquas. “It’s nice having so many guys in the camp because usually the two squads are divided, but now we have a lot of people working towards one goal, and as you can see it paid off for the Stormers last week against the Lions and hopefully it can pay off for us this week against the Griquas.” The match kicks off at 7pm.
