Inflation eased a bit in January, with headline inflation dipping to 5.7% from 5.9% in December, mainly thanks to lower fuel prices, while the consumer price index (CPI) increased by 0.2% between December and January, compared to a monthly rate of 0.6% in December. According to Statistics South Africa, motorists and businesses breathed a little easier in January as fuel prices dropped by 2.8%, from record highs of December when the price of inland 95-octane petrol decreased by 68c per litre, and the average price of diesel decreased by 25c.

Annual hotel inflation was 2.8% in January, the highest reading since June 2019 (3.1%).  The increase in hotel prices follows increasing occupancy rates in the sector, with the occupancy rate at 33.2% in November 2021, according to the latest tourist accommodation data, much higher than the low of 1.5% recorded in May 2020, but still worse than the average of 50% recorded in 2019.

Statistics SA updates the CPI basket to account for shifting household spending habits, as well as changes in technology and new consumer trends. The updated CPI basket consists of 415 items, compared to 404 in 2016. The group says inflation dynamics have changed dramatically locally and abroad and South Africa’s headline inflation rate has increased by 2.5 ppts from the 3.2% year-on-year of January 2021, but core price inflation remains little changed on an annual basis. “Burgeoning oil prices are expected to continue adding upward pressure on consumer prices, while strong demand for fertilizer will likely continue to fuel chemical prices. Crop losses caused by flood damage across various parts of South Africa in recent months pose a risk to the inflation outlook.” Looking ahead, the group says it considers it likely that headline inflation could touch 6% during the coming months, but the impact of base effects should see annual inflation moderate from the second quarter. The group has revised its forecasts and expects inflation to average 5.3% in 2022.
