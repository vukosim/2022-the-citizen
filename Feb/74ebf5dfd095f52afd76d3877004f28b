We are not sure if he was completely unpaid or his salary was paid in half like it has happened with some of the players in the team since December,” said the source. Phakaaathi reported previously about how salary problems had caused unhappiness at Swallows with some players not having been paid in full in the last few months. “The situation is so bad that you can even see it at training that there is no motivation. The vibe that used to be there is gone and those that come to training are just doing it not because they enjoy or like it anymore. They even lost a friendly game against amateurs last week and you could tell from their body language that things are not well,” said the source.
