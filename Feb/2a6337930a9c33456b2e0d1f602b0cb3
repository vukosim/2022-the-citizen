Here is the Ultimate Lifestyle Boost to a healthy day.  2.   Stay hydrated! Drink water and eat your water too. Fresh fruit and veg contain the most percentage of H2O. 3.   Clean, peel, chop and store your fruit and veg every week- read to cook up for those on-the-go lifestyles. 4.   Cook double! Collect/invest in some decent food containers, eat half and freeze the other half. 5.   Eat foods that boost sun protection. Foods with high amounts of antioxidants (e.g lycopene). Foods like tomatoes,     watermelon, berries, green tea, broccoli, dark chocolate, foods high in vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids.  6.   Get sufficient sleep, people who do not get enough sleep tend to make poor food choices that are higher in fat, sugar and calories. 7.   Get creative with leftovers! Some foods are even better the next day- think curries/pasta sauce/soups- a soup can always become a sauce. 8.   Limit dishes to limit wash-up time. Eat with your hands and serve meals on a big platter, shared with friends and family instead of individual plates. 9.   Be more conscious of your food choices. Cut down on foods with high amounts of sugar and extra additives. These lead to a host of illnesses and slow the body down. 10. Boost your meals by adding superfoods like Moringa, Chia seeds, Maca and Omega-3, found in our B-well Oil and mayos- for added benefits on the body.
