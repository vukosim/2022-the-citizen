The area surrounding City Hall will be fully closed on Thursday. President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the Sona at 7pm.  Corporation Street between Darling and Longmarket Streets will be completely closed to motorists. A walking path is available for pedestrians. The following roads are also affected by the closure of the perimeter of City Hall until 16 February:  Temporary closures on the following routes between 5:45pm and 7pm:  Contingency closures in the case of an emergency will also take place from 8am to 11:45pm, applying to roads contained in parking restrictions.  NOW READ: Sona 2022: R1.9 million set aside for this year’s event
