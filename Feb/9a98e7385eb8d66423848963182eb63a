KENILWORTH BEST BET Race 5: Silver Darling (2) to win. Apache Dream was seen as the most likely contender to chase home Silver Darling in Race 5, a FM 76 Handicap over 1800m. She has, however, been scratched. With her not in the field, Justin Snaith’s runner with Grant van Niekerk in the saddle looks to be in the perfect position to record her third career win. This Silvano filly drops down in class after contesting the Listed Ardmore Jamaica Handicap over 2000m during the L’Ormarins Queen’s Plate Festival last time out. VALUE BET Race 8: Quartet: Float 3+7 with 1, 2, 5, 9 R15 will give you around 10%.
