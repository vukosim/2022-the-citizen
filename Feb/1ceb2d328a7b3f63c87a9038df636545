As South Africa has to deal with another round of load shedding, people including celebrities are sharing their frustration’s with Eskom and Pearl Thusi is one of them. The actress was reacting to an article, that reported the power utility wants people who generate their own power to pay a fee for using the national grid as a backup.  Thusi was not happy with this suggestion because she was planning to go off the grind.  “Our country is being run by gangsters who have to resort to scamming the public for their own incompetence,” she tweeted.

I’m done with load shedding guys. I hope God blesses you with the strength to free yourself from the shackles of messy municipalities!” Eskom announced load shedding will now be reduced to Stage 1 until Monday 5am.  However when news broke that load shedding would return, another celebrity Lesego Tlhabi wasn’t happy, adding that the petrol increase just added to locals problems with their budgets.  Thusi dominated the Twitter trends last weekend when she went on a date with Michael Bucwa, popularly known as Mr Smeg.  In the days leading up to the date, Pearl had been hyping up the date which was used as a platform to put the spotlight on black-owned South African businesses using the hashtag #NationalLunchDate. The pair began the date with some small talk after Mucwa revealed that he lives in Pretoria. The conversation then became about how the date came about as Pearl sought to find out his motivation for asking her (and other women) on the date.
