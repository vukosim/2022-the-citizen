Mitsubishi has officially confirmed rumours pertaining to the unveiling of the all-new ASX by announcing 2023 as the unveiling year of the second generation model. Known as the RVR in Japan and Outlander Sport in North America, the automaker, towards the end of last month, teased the newcomer in the shape of an outline sketch on a product presentation slide at a Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance future line-up product conference in Japan.  Set to adhere to the alliance’s “leader-follower” strategy announced back in 2020, the ASX, judging by the mentioned shape, will mirror the design of the Nissan Juke and Renault Captur, albeit with the Dynamic Shield front facia grafted on. It is therefore expected to become the latest model to ride on the CMF-B platform also used by the Renault Clio and certain Dacia models, with production set to take place in France instead of Japan for the European market.

While no further information was provided, reports have pointed to a likely debut in early 2023 with details, comprising spy images of prototypes and possibly also technical specifications, projected to become a reality over the coming months. The confirmation of the ASX’s reveal comes weeks after a surprise secondary update to the South African model, where the line-up received an expansion after being cut to two in 2020. As mentioned, expect clearer details to become apparent soon.
