Mamelodi Sundowns co-head coach Manqoba Mngqithi has debunked the perception that Teboho Mokoena is a replacement for Hlompho Kekana, who served the Chloorkop-based side with distinction for about 10 years. Mokoena may end up donning Kekana’s old jersey No.8 but that is no suggestion that he is at Downs to replace their decorated former skipper.

We have a lot of players but it is always important to add a midfielder who brings in some goals and Mokoena is that kind of a midfielder that will help us with set-pieces. His passing range is very good, short, medium and long. He is a hard working midfielder and he is very focused,” said Mngqithi. Kekana left the team in November last year after he and Downs could not find common ground where game time is concerned. He was allegedly offered a behind the scenes role but he decided to leave the club and look for game time elsewhere as he is still a free agent. “Those shoes are very big to fill. He is slightly different from Hlompho, he can play as a No.6 and No.8 and he can do well in a 4-3-3 formation as No.8 or in a 4-4-2 as a No.6. We know what he can give to us and it gives us a lot of variations that we would like to try and see what we can get. In the friendly that we played against Jwaneng Galaxy, he scored three goals,” said Mngqithi. Mokoena has a couple of Bafana Bafana caps under his belt and if he were to continue to make the cut in Hugo Broos’ side, he will need to make sure he becomes a regular at Downs. “He is a national team player and that means has the responsibility to play match-in match-out. When you play for the national team, you are not only fighting to play for Sundowns, you have to maintain your place in the national team. We have a lot of players who have a lot to lose if they don’t fight for their places. I believe he is going to help us a lot,” his coach said.
