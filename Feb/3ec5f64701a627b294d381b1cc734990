He says if they can stick to what they know best, and focus more on their strengths they will have a better chance.

It is unfortunate that we lost due to some mistakes we committed in the game,” says the former Orlando Pirates man.  Usuthu will meet Horoya at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Friday at 9 pm and Sikhakhane wants them to capitalize on home ground advantage.  “Now that we are going to our second game, I think we must utilize what we learnt in the last one. One of the things we learnt is that we should limit mistakes. This time we must do everything we can to win especially because we are at home.  “The guys are in good spirits and pumped up for the game. We want to do well, do better to ensure we advance to the next round of this competition. We are new in this tournament and I think we should do things our own way. We have played difficult games already like the one against TP Mazembe.  “We went to that game with a winning mentality. We wanted to win and we focused more on our strengths. If we do the same again this time I believe we can get the full points,” adds Sikhakhane.
