KENILWORTH BEST BET RACE 6 NO 4 LONG WHITE CLOUD – WINThis Eric Sands-trained lucky was a very unlucky loser last time. She looked a winner but started to hang at a crucial stage and got snared on the line by Duplicity.The two will meet again but Long White Cloud is drawn No 1 and is 0.5kg better off.Bred in Ireland, she is actually six months younger than her local counterparts and issill maturing.
