The race card for Wednesday’s Scottsville race meeting is not one for embracing – unless you’re a masochist. It’s a Gordian knot, tangled and crepuscular; full of imponderables and inscrutability; fulinginous and annoying. A can of worms. So, an irresistible challenge to devoted punters then! After all, a tough card usually means big pay outs. Crack the blighter, you’re rolling in it, baby. The holy grail is finding a race or races in which you can narrow the choice down to just a couple of likely candidates. On Wednesday, this might be the seventh, a 1200m MR 84 Handicap and the highest-rated race of the day. If we’re lucky, this will be a two-horse affair, with Go Man Go and Coin Spinner fighting it out. The former, trained by Andre Nel, enjoys this quirky racecourse and is a consistent galloper. He once beat the well-regarded Captain Tatters over this course and distance. Go Man Go is returning from a 94-day break but runs well fresh and has in-form apprentice jockey Rachel Venniker to urge him along. Coin Spinner, from Tony Rivalland’s stable, goes for a hat-trick following two victories on the Greyville turf. If he adapts to Scottsville, he’ll surely be in the mix at the top of the hill. One other horse that looks a bit of a standout is Sting Ray in the last. Otherwise, it’s blindfold-and-dart time.
