It is also disappointing to see how they are trying to cause a rift between all the relevant parties; the club, the agent, the coach and in particular, the supporters,” read the release.“The fact is, the terms of the contract have all been agreed upon between the Al-Ahly representative and the agent.“The speculation by the media and in particular on social media platforms is unfounded. Out of respect for Al-Ahly, we will wait for their formal response on the status of the contract.“Our coach is committed to continuing his role as the head coach of Al-Ahly and as his management agency, are committed to ensuring that we meet his mandate,” added the release.
