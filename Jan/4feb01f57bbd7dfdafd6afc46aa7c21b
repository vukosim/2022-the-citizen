The talented Grade 10 youngster scored for Coastal in their 3-0 win over Dinaledi in the semi-finals of the competition, having came on as a second half substitute. Lentjies, who was roped in as a technical adviser for Coastal, says the technical team was content with the young player’s contribution in the game. “Sixteen years old, first touch and he scores a goal. But not just the goal, everything he did after that as well. So I am happy for him, but not just me. Everybody in the technical team was happy for him. He wouldn’t be here if we and the supporters who voted for him didn’t think he was capable,” said Lentjies. “He showed it in training, and it was a given he would come on. We decided that the boy deserved to play the way he was training.” The Chilli Boys coach continued to rave about the teenager and he believes Sifumba has a very bright future ahead of him. “With coach Eric Tinkler knowing him from Cape Town City and coach Steve Barker having a look at him for the first time in training … Wow, what a player for the future. And not even the future, why not now?” Nicknamed “Kaka”, Sifumba has been part of City’s reserves side since last year, making history with the club by becoming the youngest player to feature in the DDC at the age of 15 years.
