Trainer Paul Peter’s 18.5% winners-to-runners ratio makes him one of the South African punter’s biggest allies in the racing game. He’s surely the man to follow at Turffontein on Tuesday, when racing takes place on the Inside track. Peter could make an early impact with Mychancetodream in Race 1. This young filly disappointed last time when heavily backed, but the vet reported that she hung in the latter stages and got her tongue over the bit. She drops in distance and gets a tongue-tie, so similar problems might be dodged. However, the opposition is perhaps a tad sterner this time, with Candice Dawson stablemates Portrayal and Charge Down looking the likely threats. Peter has clearer winning chances in Races 4 and 5 with Vegas Hi Rise and Smorgasbord, respectively. The latter is touted as the best bet on the card, thanks to good form over the last 10 months. The only minor blemish on his record was a distant fourth to the hotshot Desert Miracle in the Grade 2 Graham Back Stakes in October. But Smorgasbord did show early speed in that encounter over 1450m and now drops to 1200m. Also, that was a second start after a break, which sometimes brings a flat performance. After that run, he was gelded by Peter and shot back to his best with a good win over 1200m at the Vaal. Gavin Lerena rode him to victory there and returns to try for the follow-up. Peter’s stable jockey Warren Kennedy is the man in charge of likely favourite Suited Connector in Race 8. This chap is consistent, well overdue a second career victory and could rate a second Peter-stable banker for exotics players on a tight budget.
