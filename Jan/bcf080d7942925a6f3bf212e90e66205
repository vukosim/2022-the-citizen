As with every new year, people set up new health and body goals for themselves, and most want to know how soon they could see results after kicking off their workout plans.   Whether it be the pressure of social media, changes in your body due to motherhood, or eating habits, the health industry has been criticised for its inconsistent messaging when it comes to a healthy mind and body.  People who have set themselves targets often want to see results quickly.  Personal trainer, Amanda Hughes told The Independent the people who can expect those results are the ones who have never exercised before.  “If you’ve never exercised before, you can expect to see results much faster than someone who has been training for years, as their bodies will be more conditioned,” she said.

She said being realistic is more sustainable and will make it easier to stay on your health journey. Hughes said finding something you enjoy in fitness is very important for your success.
