A number of young players have been impressive in the DStv Compact Cup, and Stellenbosch FC coach Steve Barker reckons the players should be protected, because they are the future of South African football. ALSO READ: DStv Compact Cup has build friendships – Masuluke Mduduzi Shabalala of Kaizer Chiefs, who plays for Warriors FC and Cape Town City’s Luphumlo “Kaka” Sifumba, who plays for Coastal United, are just a couple of youngsters who have raised their hands for first team action following their impressive display in the semifinals. Shabalala helped Warriors beat Amabutho FC by coming up with an assist for Monnapule Saleng, which saw Warriors win 2-1, while Sifumbo scored in Coastal United’s 3-0 victory over Dinaledi FC last weekend. Barker, who coaches the Coastal squad, spoke about how amazing Sipfumba has been at training and he has shown a lot of maturity for a 16-years old. “To take the goal like he (Sipfumba) did, he showed great quality, tactical ability and tactical awareness. In training, he’s fitted in superbly. He doesn’t look out of place and that is exciting for us. We’ve just got to trust and hope these young talented players that we have in our country have better pathways that are created for them so that the national team can gain. It’s important that we learn new things as there’s work to be done,” said Barker “From the DDC team, there needs to be a selected team and those players need to be taken care of so that in four-five years’ time we can benefit from the great initiative that the DStv have and the resources put into the league.” Sipfumba and Shabalala are set to meet should they both get a chance to play when Warriors take on Coastal in the Compact Cup final to be played at FNB Stadium on Saturday. Before the final, Amabutho and Dinaledi will battle it out for the third/fourth place spots at the same venue in an earlier fixture.
