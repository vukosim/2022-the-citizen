Bulls flanker, Reinhardt Ludwig, will make his United Rugby Championship debut in the South African North versus South derby where the side will take on the Stormers at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday. The 19-year-old, who has been a key figure in the Bulls’ Under-20 side over the past year, is an exciting addition to a strong Bulls side that will look to begin their 2022 campaign in the cross-hemisphere competition on the right note.  There will be no shortage of experience alongside Ludwig, with Arno Botha starting at openside flanker while Elrigh Louw will be at No 8. Springbok centre Cornal Hendricks will captain the side this weekend.
