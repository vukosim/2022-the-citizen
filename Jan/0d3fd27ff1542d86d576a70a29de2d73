The heels of your feet usually crack when the skin around the rim of your heel becomes dry and thick.  There are many other factors, however, that can cause cracked heels, such as obesity, wearing open-heeled shoes, and having cold and dry skin.  If you suffer from dry, rough and cracked heels, you should try out these two homemade remedies that can help get rid of the dead, dry skin on your heels, and smoothen your heels.  This hack shared by Alssa on TikTok makes use of lemon and salt to get rid of dry, cracked and rough heels.  In the video, she starts off by cutting a lemon in half, before dipping the other half into a bowl of salt to pick up the salt on its open surface.  She then takes the lemon which is covered in salt, and rubs her heel with the two ingredients until her heels feel and look different.  Once she is done, she then rinses off her heels with water, and then applies moisturizer to her heels to keep them soft and smooth.
