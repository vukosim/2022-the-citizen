Gavin Hunt believes that his honesty could have led to his axing at Chippa United.ALSO READ: Chiefs working around the clock to wrap-up Sithebe dealThe 57-year-old coach was fired by Chippa in December last year after being placed on a ‘precautionary leave’ having being joined after he was sacked by Kaizer Chiefs.  “Maybe I am too honest. Maybe I talk too much and am too opinionated, and club bosses dislike honesty in coaches. I lost my coaching job because of that,” Hunt told the Daily Sun after being asked about his Chippa departure. “But I will never change my principle for anyone else. I will stick to what I believe in.” Hunt is currently working as an analyst at SuperSport TV for the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) games, but the former Black Leopards and Swallows mentor says he is available to return to coaching should the right offer be made to him. He has also received an invitation from Manchester City and he is set to travel to England after the ongoing 2021 Africa Cup of Nations finals.“I will attend their training sessions and matches and hopefully learn as much as I can when I get there.“I will check out the environment and see if there are opportunities. I got an invitation from a friend, who works at the club,” he explained. “For now, I am enjoying my role as an analyst at SuperSport, but I am available to take on new job offers.” “In SA, it’s about who you know and not about your coaching experience and qualifications. I am ready for my next coaching challenge. I had good jobs and believe they will come again,” he added.  “I am still looking, and nothing is available at the moment. I am willing to take any job that comes my way,” concluded Hunt.
