Tributes have poured in for veteran triathlete Andre Piehl, who died after being hit by a car while training at the Cradle of Humankind over the weekend. Piehl, who was on his bike, was reportedly hit by a drunk driver. The 49-year-old amateur athlete, who worked as an operations executive, represented South Africa in various age groups at international level. In 2011, he finished 11th in the 40-44 division at the ITU Long Distance Triathlon World Championships in Nevada, and he went on to compete at the ultra-distance Ironman World Championships in Hawaii in 2017. He also finished sixth against younger opponents, in the elite age group, at the national championships in 2013.
