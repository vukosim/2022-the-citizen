A four-month-old baby girl died when nurses allegedly refused to end their lunch break so they could attend to her at the Dr Bevan Goqwana Clinic in Qumbu on Monday. The mother of the critically ill child was allegedly told by the nurses to wait outside the Eastern Cape clinic until their lunchbreak was over. However, by the time they attended to the baby, her health had deteriorated, which resulted in her death. Eastern Cape Health MEC, Nomakhosazana Meth, has ordered a thorough investigation into the incident.
