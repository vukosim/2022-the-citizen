Following his explosive performance last week in the DStv Compact Cup, Kaizer Chiefs shot-stopper Itumeleng Khune is humbled by the reaction he got the from football fans.Khune made a number of saves for Warriors FC in the semi-final against Amabutho FC, which saw them win 2-1 at Moses Mabhida Stadium last weekend and reached the final where they will play Coastal United at FNB Stadium on Saturday. The former Bafana Bafana and Amakhosi number one has not been utilised by Chiefs in months now, with head coach Stuart Baxter preferring Daniel Akpeyi to his first choice, while Bruse Bvuma has   “It means a lot and I am humbled by the reception I am getting from the country. I’ve been in this game for more than a decade and the fact that fans still appreciate my talent and what I can deliver on the day humbles me. I will keep rewarding them with great performances whenever I get given the opportunity,” said Khune during the Compact Cup press conference on Thursday. At 34 years of age Khune remains hopeful that he will get back his number one jersey at Chiefs and says he will retire when he is older than former Italy number one Gianluigi Buffon. Buffon is 44 years old.  “I will retire when I am older than Buffon. I will retire after him. I still have maybe 10 more years. To be quite honest, I am making a good investment in myself by investing in a gym at home. I do a lot of extras at my work place and even when I get home I am motivated to do extra (work), so that I can improve myself and be in good shape. My body is my investment. When I invest in my body, it can take me until I am over 40. That’s what I am praying for.”
