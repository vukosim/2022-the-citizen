A former SBV Services security guard, who allegedly stole R4 million in cash from her employer in 2019, on Monday abandoned her bid to be released on bail. Bathobile Mlangeni, 31, made a brief appearance at the Alexandra Magistrate’s Court on charges of theft. Mlangeni was arrested in Zola, Soweto, on 6 January 2022 after police received a tip-off on her whereabouts. She had been on the run from authorities for more than two years.
