India paceman Mohammed Shami struck twice in one over to undermine South Africa’s first innings on the second day of the third Test at Newlands on Wednesday, with Keegan Petersen standing firm to steer the Proteas to 176/7 at tea. Shami’s breakthrough came in the 56th over as Petersen and Temba Bavuma were busy leading South Africa to calmer waters after a tough morning session had seen them battle to 100/3. The wicket of Rassie van der Dussen (21), caught in the slips, fell to Umesh Yadav in the fifth over after the break, leaving the home side on 112/4, still 111 runs shy of India’s first innings of 223. But Bavuma took the attack to the Indian bowlers, while Petersen completed his second half-century in successive Tests, needing 101 deliveries for the milestone.

Two balls later, Kyle Verreynne departed for a duck as he failed to move his feet and, prodding at an away-swinger from the crease, was caught behind off Shami. Marco Jansen (7) was then comprehensively bowled by Jasprit Bumrah on the stroke of tea. The 28-year-old Petersen ran with the form he showed in the second Test at the Wanderers, where he scored 62 and 28, as he went to tea on a career-best 70 not out. It had been a defiant four-hour innings rich in strokeplay, with the Paarl product collecting nine boundaries, but he was also rock-solid defensively. India fast bowlers Bumrah (17.2-6-29-3), Shami (16-4-39-2) and Yadav (12-3-50-2) kept roaring in on a warm day in Cape Town, with the pitch flattening out.
