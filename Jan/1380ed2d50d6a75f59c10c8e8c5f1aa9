Most plants, fruits and vegetables thrive the best when they are planted ahead of the warmer and sunnier seasons such as spring and summer because the heat and sunlight promote their healthy and rapid growth. Although there are some fruits and vegetables which can be planted ahead of the colder and drier seasons such as autumn and winter, sometimes the biggest challenge in successfully growing these plants would be the lack of sunlight due to the gloomy weather mostly experienced in these seasons.   If your outdoor garden is positioned in a way that allows it to get maximum sunlight throughout the day in the seasons of autumn and winter, then you could consider growing your own vegetables which thrive throughout the colder seasons.  Garlic is one of the easiest plants to grow, and usually goes under the ground to grow throughout the season of winter, before being harvested in summer.  To ensure that your garlic is protected from the extreme cold weather, you can add mulch to the compost, which will also protect the plant from weeds.  Cabbage can be planted ahead of winter, and harvested from the season of summer right through to the season of spring.  To protect your cabbage from winter pests, you can cover the crop with a floating row cover around your garden, and if you notice your cabbages growing slowly, then you can add some finished compost around your cabbages and water your cabbages well.  To harvest your carrots in winter, make sure that you plant them well ahead of spring so you can give them time to grow to your desired size for eating.  Once the temperature drops, carrots do not usually grow bigger, but can remain fresh under the ground for months. Onions are another crop which can spend months underground during the colder seasons. Plant seedlings in your garden in summer ahead of autumn, and protect your crop with mulch mixed into the compost or with floating row covers.
