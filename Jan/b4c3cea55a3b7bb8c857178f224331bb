Pets are manâ€™s best friend, but they can also be a lot of work to maintain their health and lifestyle. The love you get from your pets is, however, definitely worth it.  Adam Christman has taken to TikTok to share his handy daily hacks which make it much easier to clean up after his pets in his home.  Pets usually rub against glass doors to have a closer look at what is going on on the other side of the door, or to attempt to find a great escape.  This often leaves tiny nose prints which can be stubborn to remove without using a combination of detergents and window or glass cleaners.  Adam suggests using magic cleaning erasers to get rid of the stains and marks to leave your window or glass door looking squeaky clean.

Having your pets pee on your furniture can leave an unwanted stain, or an awful stench which could spread throughout your home.  If your pets tend to pee on your carpets, Adam suggests sprinkling some baking powder over the pee area, and then leaving the baking powder on there for 15 minutes, before vacuuming your carpet.  The baking powder neutralizes the smell of the pee, and gets rid of any stains from your pets pee.  Pet hair can be the most frustrating aspect of owning pets as their hair always manages to stay on every single surface, other than your actual pets.  Adam suggests making use of a squeegee to get rid of any pet hair that may be on your carpets or furniture. He also says that you can use latex gloves to clean your furniture from pet hair, or fabric softener sheets which will also leave your furniture smelling super fresh.
