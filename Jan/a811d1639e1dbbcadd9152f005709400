The Summerveld satellite yard of Dean Kannemeyer sends two horses to the Polytrack race meeting at Greyville on Wednesday and could come away with a 100% success rate. Assistant trainer Nicolette Roscoe saddles Heartsease in the fourth and Name Of The Game in the fifth, two three-year-old fillies who’ve recently shown aptitude when tried over more ground. Heartsease posted her maiden win over 1400m as a juvenile in March last year but has been tried over 1900m and 2000m in recent months – to good effect, with four finishes in the money. This 1900m FM 67 Handicap looks a plum target, especially with stable faithful Keagan de Melo jumping her from a No 4 gate. De Melo also rides Name Of The Game, who goes over 2000m in a FM73 Handicap. This girl got off the mark in December over this trip, though on the Greyville turf. Last time she was dropped back to 1600m – again on turf – and just failed to catch the winner after accelerating smartly in the dying stages. Again, this engagement appears well-timed by the stable and a quick Kannemeyer Double would not be the worst bet one could place.
