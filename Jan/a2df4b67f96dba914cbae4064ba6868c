The Rockets are at the bottom of the league table after only managing to collect 13 points in their last 17 games. With the way things have gone for the Rockets, Kwem, a former Chippa United player, says he understands the situation that the club finds itself in, and he is willing to go all out to ensure that they survive relegation. “It’s a reality check where we are on the log, we are hoping for the best for the second half of the season. I am eager to get back, I haven’t played in a long time because of the injury, but now I am fine, I just thank God that I am up for selection and when I am given a chance I will give my best for the team,” said the striker. “It’s something emotional, for me, it’s the first time I get seriously injured. Throughout my stay at Chippa, I only had a few knocks and I would be out for a day or two. It’s the first time I have a muscle tear, but thank God the physiotherapist helped me to get back to full fitness. When you think about your family at home, my younger brother, and also the team, the badge, when you think about where we are on the log, pushed me to be back because I know what I can offer the team.” With the league only resuming in mid February due to the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, Galaxy have some time to prepare for their two opening fixtures of the year against Stellenbosch FC and AmaZulu FC.
