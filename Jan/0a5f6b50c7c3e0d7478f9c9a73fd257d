Thabo Matlaba wants out at Swallows FC, Phakaaathi has heard. ALSO READ: Swallows alleged to have failed to pay December salariesThe Soweto side recently parted ways with Vuyo Mere who had helped the team back to the top-flight two seasons ago.  It has now emerged that Matlaba also wants out at Swallows and has handed in a transfer request to the club asking to be released. A source said Matlaba is unhappy about a number of things at the Dube Birds and has opted to be released so he can try elsewhere.  “A lot of the older guys are unsettled at the team. There have been talks of salary cuts and such things and that has made them uncomfortable.  “These guys are family men and have people dependent on their salaries so if you want to cut or fiddle with their earnings they will not be happy,” said a source.  Phakaaathi has also learnt that the club is considering Matlaba’s case and a decision should be made before the end of the day on Monday.  If he is granted his wish, Matlaba will then be free to join a club of his choice even after the transfer window has closed. The window closes at on Monday night.  It has also emerged that Matlaba could not struggle to find a club with Royal AM said to have already asked about his situation.
