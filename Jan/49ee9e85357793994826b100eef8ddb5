The funeral service for the late Emalahleni municipality mayor Linah Malatjie and her husband Essau is currently underway, after the pair perished in a head-on collision in Mpumalanga on Monday morning.  “Her passing has robbed not only her family of a mother, but the municipality – and the entire Mpumalanga province – of a leader with a wealth of experience in local government,” Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshwani-Tsipane said earlier this week.  A memorial service was held for the Malatjies on Wednesday.  ALSO READ: Category 2 funeral for Emalahleni mayor?
