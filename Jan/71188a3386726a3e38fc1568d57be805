The Olympic, World and Commonwealth Games swimming champion, Chad le Clos, might have taken the world by storm with his butterfly record, but over the past weekend he has taken social media by storm by wearing a Scottish kilt to his swimming buddy, Leith Shankland’s wedding. “What an amazing weekend,” he wrote in an Instagram post in which he poses for a photo with the groom, Shankland, and another best man, Ryan Passmore. “Shank, so proud of you and Ash, it was a magical day, honoured to be best man with @ryanjaypassmore.” Even though many might argue that Le Clos, who is the Commonwealth record holder in the 50 and 100-metre butterfly, looks better in a speedo, there is just something about a man in uniform and even more so, a man in a kilt. Le Clos looked dashing in a green and blue traditional Scottish kilt, complete with knee-high socks, a sporran and a royal blue tie. Now, the question is: Which did he wear best? The wedding was held at Providence Country Weddings in the Kwazulu-Natal Midlands, boasting brilliant backdrops for wedding guests to pose for a photo with the swimmers.

In the photo he kisses her on her cheek while she holds a heart that says: “Kiss me.” Some more photos of Chad and Jeanni posing at the wedding’s photobooth were shared by Photobooth Lab. Their caption of the carousel of photos mentioned that “it was so awesome bumping into these two incredibly down to earth humans!” So, what’s the verdict? Does Le Clos look better in a speedo or a kilt?
