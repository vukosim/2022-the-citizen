As the country strives to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, President Cyril Ramaphosa says science and technology have a key role to play in economic recovery. In his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa said science and innovation should play a “more prominent role both in efforts to overcome the disease and rebuild the economy”.  He says South Africa “already has advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities in companies like Aspen Pharmacare, Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines and Biovac Institute”. Ramaphosa also cited SpaceX’s recent Falcon 9 rocket launch, which successfully carried three South African-made nanosatellites into space. The launch of the nanosatellite constellation will further cement South Africa’s position as an African leader in small satellite development. Read President Ramaphosa’s full letter below.
