On track to make its eagerly awaited debut in the first quarter of this year, BMW has quietly divulged pricing details of the all-new 2 Series Coupe. Unveiled at last year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, the new Two rides on a revised version of Munich’s CLAR platform, meaning it retains the rear-wheel-drive configuration of its predecessor, instead of using the front-wheel-drive FAAR architecture that underpins the 2 Series Gran Coupe and 2 Series Active Tourer. Wider, longer, and more practical than before, the mostly made-out-of-aluminium 2 Series Coupe arrives sporting a choice of three models, headed by the all-wheel-drive M240i xDrive. A replacement for the outgoing M2 is expected to join later.

Top speed is rated at 236 km/h with the 0-100 km/h sprint taking 7.5 seconds. With the next step-up 230i being forbidden fruit, the final non-sporting derivative comes in the shape of the oil-burning 220d.  Aided by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system that adds an additional eight kilowatts for short spells, the equally familiar 2.0-litre unit punches out 140kW/400Nm, which BMW claims translates to a top speed of 237 km/h and 0-100 km/h in seven seconds. As mentioned, the M240i xDrive, for now, reigns as the line-up’s flagship with its 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six pumping out 285kW/500Nm. Equipped with the mentioned all-paw gripping system for the first time, the M240i will get from 0-100 km/h in a claimed 4.3 seconds and top out at 250 km/h. In a 2 Series first, all of the powerunits are mated to the eight-speed Steptronic gearbox as the previous six-speed manual departs entirely. The otherwise optional sports ratio setup is however standard on the M240i. Expect exact model specification to be fully revealed closer to the still outstanding local launch date.
