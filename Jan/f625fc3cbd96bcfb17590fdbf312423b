The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) has classified the recent damaging rainy weather in parts of the country as a national disaster. It has been reported that the heavy summer rain has thus far claimed over 80 lives, caused damage to property, infrastructure and the environment due to flooding, sinkholes and landslides. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs spokesperson Lungi Mtshali said the decision to classify the weather pattern as a national disaster came after consultation with all provinces on the extent of the damages. Mtshali said the classification was in line with the mandate of the Head of NDMC under section 23 of the Disaster Management Act, 57 of 2002.

The public has been urged to observe weather warnings issued by the South African Weather Service, and to practice safety measures in the face of continuing rains and floods. “A special plea is particularly made to those who are located in low lying areas to take precautionary measures including relocation away from those risky areas,” said Mtshali.
