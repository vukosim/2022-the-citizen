The NSC results will include information about the pass rate of South Africa’s nine provinces. Then on 21 January, provinces will be authorised to release their results. The IEB results for SA’s private and independent schools are in, proving that the country’s matrics were, for the second year in a row, the real MVPs. Despite the challenges synonymous with finishing Grade 12 during a worldwide pandemic, the class of 2021 achieved a pass rate of 98.39%.  This is 0.32% higher than the class of 2020, which recorded a pass rate of 98.07% during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemic.
