Free State recorded 128 cases followed by Eastern Cape (99) and Northern Cape (56) had the lowest cases for Sunday. Earlier this week, the NICD indicated that the latest known Covid-19 variant – BA.2 – is not a cause for concern yet. NICD held a meeting on Wednesday, 26 January as part of their Covid-19 series: Decoding the Science. They discussed issues including vaccine efficacy and the immune response to Omicron. The new version of the virus is a descendent of the Omicron variant (now referred to as BA.1) that was responsible for the country’s fourth wave of infections. BA.2 was first identified in South Africa and India in late December 2021.  Although other sub-lineages have been identified, they have not been in the public eye due to the increase in cases of people who have contracted the BA.2 variant.
