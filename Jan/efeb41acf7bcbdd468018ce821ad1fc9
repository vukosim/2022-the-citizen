For now, Bradely Ralani can be easily described as Mamelodi Sundowns’ marquee signing in the current transfer window, with Teboho Mokoena still heavily linked with the Brazilians.

Ralani, who spent most of his career abroad where he played for Swedish sides Landskronka and Helsingborg before making his debut in the Premier Soccer League a little over three years ago, is in much awe of the quality that his new team possesses in terms of personnel, and he believes having players such as Themba “Mshishi” Zwane around him will only improve his game. Speaking to Power FM, Ralani said he was not at Sundowns to add numbers but believes his abilities will add value to the side as they are in pole-position to defend the DStv Premiership – which will be a record extending fifth league crown on the spin. “I’ve seen them for the first time in pre-season when we played here (Chloorkop) and I saw something special. Everyone knows what Themba Zwane does and there are a lot of other players I want to train with that can make me better and they can also get better around me. There are a lot of quality players and that is why they are all here, if I were to name all of them the list would not end,” said Ralani.While the championship is for Masandawana to lose, seeing that they are 14 points clear off Orlando Pirates on the log standings, signings such as Ralani are to bolster their desire to reclaim continental glory in the form of the Caf Champions League which they won in 2016 under then coach Pitso Mosimane.
