Eight suspects have been arrested for the murder of Colonel Beauty Marivate, who was gunned down in a supermarket robbery on 30 December 2021. The slain colonel met her sudden death when she responded to a burglary at a local supermarket in the Elukwatini area in Mpumalanga.  Police spokesperson Captain Gugu Phiri told News 24 that Marivate “immediately rushed to the scene as other officers made their way to provide back-up. Upon arrival, she was noticed by the suspects. A shootout ensued and she was shot and injured in the process.” Marivate is being laid to rest today.
