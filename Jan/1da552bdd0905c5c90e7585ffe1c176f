The now three-year-old joint venture between Toyota and Suzuki’s Maruti division in India will reportedly spawn yet another new model later this year. What will be the seventh model after the Starlet/Glanza based on the Baleno, the Urban Cruiser spun-off of the Vitara Brezza, the Rumion derived from the Ertiga, the Belta that uses the Ciaz as a base and in Europe, the Across/Vitara and Swace/Corolla Touring Sports, Autocar India reports that the new entrant will be an SUV aimed directly at the Hyundai Creta. In a reversal of the current status quo though, the newcomer will not be a Suzuki assembled vehicle rebadged as a Toyota. Instead, the roles will be reversed with production set to take place at Toyota’s Bidadi plant in the state of Bengaluru.

The architecture is anticipated to be adapted though in order for both models to compete with the Creta on size and interior space. Accordingly, emphasis will be placed on hybrid propulsion with Toyota’s Hybrid Synergy Drive system set to feature instead of Suzuki’s own Smart Hybrid mild-hybrid setup used by numerous models in India. Bar the internal monikers, YFG for the Suzuki and D22 for the Toyota, both models are shrouded in mystery at present, with the publication merely stating that an official debut could take place around October. It will therefore be the partnership’s second launch to take place this year as the all-new Vitara Brezza is expected to debut soon, followed by the Urban Cruiser.
