The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a warning for extremely hot conditions in the Western Cape and Northern Cape from this weekend.  “A strong upper air high pressure system will result in a sunny and drier end to the week and weekend for South Africa with extremely hot temperatures expected over the Western and Northern Cape provinces. “Extremely hot conditions expected over the interior of the West Coast from today, including the Cape Winelands, Central and Little Karoo on Saturday and Sunday. Heatwave conditions are expected mainly over the southern high ground of Namakwa (Northern Cape), Cape Winelands; in places over the interior of the West Coast and the Waterskloof LM until Sunday,” said the weather service on Friday.  As per Accuweather, Wellington and Paarl residents should brace for a high of 44°C on Saturday and 42°C degrees on Sunday. Just a friendly reminder: Don’t take your pets for walkies during a heatwave. If the tar is too hot for your hands, it’s too hot for your doggo’s paws. Close the curtains and lay damp towels on the floor to cool them off. Also, set out extra bowls of water, and maybe add a couple of ice cubes for good measure. If you can’t keep them indoors, make sure they have adequate shade to escape the heat. If you have wildlife in your region – birds, squirrels, and the like – be kind and put out bowls of water for them too. For bees – because you know, they are endangered – fill a shallow bowl or plate with water and pebbles and place in the shade for the beezies to enjoy. (The pebbles prevent them from drowning).
