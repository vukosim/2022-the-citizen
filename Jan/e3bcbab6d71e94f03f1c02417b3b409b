However, the bonus clause is challenging because one team allegedly refused to get involved in contract agreements between Maluleka and Downs, while Downs are not keen to pay him bonuses when (he is) playing for other teams,” a source revealed.Meanwhile, the recent signing of Bradley “Surprise” Ralani by Mamelodi Sundowns, who acquired the services of the playmaker from Cape Town City, may be an indication that the Brazilians are increasingly ready to let go of Gaston Sirino.ALSO READ:  Sundowns defender attracts interest from Europe However, Phakaaathi has learned that Sirino’s attitude at the club is making them increasingly unwilling to abide by the Uruguayan’s desire to leave.
