Apprentice jockey Rachel Venniker is having doors opened to her following her meteoric rise in South Africa’s riding ranks. She was even invited to ride at the weekend’s Cape Town Met meeting by none other than champion trainer Justin Snaith. Back home in Durban, she looks likely to further shine her reputation when Greyville hosts three apprentice races on its eight-race card on the Polytrack. She is fancied to win two of the three and extend her already sizeable lead in the national appy championship. Venniker’s best chance come in Race 6, an FM65 Handicap over 1400m, with Michael Roberts-trained Hatta. She and Hatta are well acquainted as Venniker is tied to the Roberts yard and has ridden the filly in both work and competition. Indeed, she was in the irons for Hatta’s maiden victory in September last year – back when the rider was still claiming 4kg. Venniker’s winning ways have seen her allowance drop to 1.5kg since then, while Hatta has had a three-month break and a promising comeback run in other hands. From a good draw, the duo make fair appeal. In Race 4, Venniker does duty for Tony Rivalland on Victory Twist, who she is not familiar with but who is in good form and also has a good draw.
