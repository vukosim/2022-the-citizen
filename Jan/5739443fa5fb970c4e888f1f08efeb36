The Western Cape High Court Monday approved a $1.6 billion (R25 billion) payout by embattled retail giant Steinhoff to settle fraud claims that emerged in 2017. Tens of thousands of claimants have sought more than $8 billion in compensation after an accounting scandal sent share prices plunging 98 percent. After years of litigation and negotiation, the High Court sitting in Cape Town agreed to the proposal in a two-page ruling delivered in a 30-minute hearing. The settlement will cover a portion of each claim, if the claimants withdraw their separate lawsuits. The clothing and furniture retailer is listed in both Frankfurt and Johannesburg. Two of Steinhoff’s managers still face trial in Germany. A court in the Netherlands, where Steinhoff is domiciled, has already approved the company’s settlement plan. This after the court ruled last year against Steinhoff International Holdings N.V.’s (SIHNV) argument that a South African court does not have jurisdiction to liquidate the company. Dismissing the application with costs, as well as the costs of two counsel, judge Hayley Slingers found that a South African court would have jurisdiction, while Steinhoff and the two other parties claimed that Steinhoff is an external company established in the Netherlands and cannot be liquidated in South Africa in terms of the Companies Act of 2008.

The 2008 act has a separate definition for an external company. The former owners of Tekkie Town applied for the liquidation of Steinhoff because they say it cannot pay its debts any longer. The former Tekkie Town owners sold their business to Steinhoff five years ago for shares in SIHNV. Additional reporting by Ina Opperman
