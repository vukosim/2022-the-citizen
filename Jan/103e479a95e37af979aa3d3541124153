What has been hailed as “a first in the world for an alcohol brand,” has left many confused about why on earth an alcohol manufacturer would want to venture into the world of fragrance. This after alcohol brand Brutal Fruit kicked off the new year with a new product; a scent called “You Belong; To Affect.”  Named after the brand’s ongoing “You Belong” campaign, the scent was announced with the simultaneous launch of a TV commercial and social media rollout.  “It goes without saying that innovation drives success and unexpected yet obvious collaborations are at the epi-centre of what is cool and relevant. This diversification is there to provide our consumers with a brand new fragrance, a scent which is stunning and will be sure to turn heads,” explained Brutal Fruit in a statement.  The launch of the new perfume left social media users with more questions than anything.  Crafted in partnership with master perfumers and inspired by Brutal Fruit lovers, the brand says that “You Belong is a one-of-a-kind fragrance that blends sparkling citrus and floral top notes with a middle of sandalwood, plum and peach, subtly underscored by a base of tonka beans, labdanum and precious woods.”  According to Brutal Fruit, the resulting bouquet “is an elegant, sensual experience that carries with it the feeling of belonging.”At the time of writing, no samples had yet been delivered to journalists so what the Brutal Fruit perfume smells like remains a mystery.  Details regarding the price of the perfume and where it will be available have also not yet been confirmed. The Citizen will furnish all information as soon as it becomes available.
