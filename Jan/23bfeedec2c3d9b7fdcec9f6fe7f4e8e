Having last year introduced the Platinum moniker for the Panamera, Porsche has now expanded the nomenclature to the Cayenne and Cayenne Coupe. Essentially an appearance package, the Platinum’s exterior difference comprise 21-inch RS Spyder Design alloy wheels, black window surrounds, black tipped exhaust outlets and satin platinum finishes on the front air takes, the central rear LED light bar and on the Porsche letting. In total, the Platinum’s colour palette spans seven hues; white, black, Carrera White Metallic, Jet Black Metallic, Mahogany, Moonlight Blue Metallic and Crayon. On the specification front, the Platinum comes as standard with the Porsche Dynamic Light System, electric leather sport seats with the Porsche badge embroidered into the front and rear headrests, an analogue clock and panoramic roof, ambient lighting and the upgraded Bose surround-sound system.
