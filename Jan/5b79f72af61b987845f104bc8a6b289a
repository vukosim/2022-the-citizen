Pretoria Callies have placed a ‘not for sale’ tag over Kgomotso Mosadi, who has been the livewire for the Romans. Mosadi has so far banged in five goals in the GladAfrica Championship and the side are not going to listen to any offers for the 26-year-old. READ ALSO: Mbule set to snub Sundowns and join Chiefs? Phakaaathi has it on good authority that a couple of Limpopo-based sides have inquired about Mosadi, but have been turned away harshly. “Look, the team is not doing well at the moment, it would be stupid for us to sell one of the guys who bangs in the goals to keep us afloat. “The player has ambition to play in the DStv Premiership, we have to put a stop to it for now and make sure we keep our best players at the club,” said a source.
