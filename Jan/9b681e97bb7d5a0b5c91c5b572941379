For a talented player like Teboho Mokoena, one can sympathise with Teboho Mokoena for being with SuperSport United for close to six years but has very little to show for it in terms of silverware.ALSO READ: Sundowns snap Mokoena from city foes Matsatsantsa A PitoriMokoena only has the MTN8 title to show for his efforts with the Pretoria-based side, which makes sense why he decided to join the more successful and dominant Mamelodi Sundowns side. Mokoena joined crosstown rivals on Thursday, becoming the fifth Matsatsantsa A Pitori player to join Masandawana in recent years, following in the footsteps of Jeremy Brockie, Reyaad Pieterse, Aubrey Modiba and Grant Kekana. His dream of winning a league title looks likely to come true in the next few months as Downs are in pole position to defend the DStv Premiership and claim it for an unprecedented fifth time on the spin. “I want to take this time to show appreciation, I am very proud of this achievement and I’m also happy with the decision that I made to join Sundowns. As the saying goes, ‘The home of Champions’, I was also born a winner and I want to see myself winning the league, competing in the Caf Champions League as well as the Fifa Club World Cup and just winning trophies,” Mokoena was quoted as saying by the Sundowns website. With Kaizer Chiefs being one of the teams that showed interest in luring Mokoena, he reveals that he has always had the desire to represent Ka Bo Yellow. “Personally I am proud of this milestone in my career, to move from SuperSport to Sundowns. It was an easy decision for me to make because this club showed interest in me and it was also a club that I had hoped to play for. I like their style of play, the way in which they are dominating the league and on the international stage as well,” the Bafana Bafana international said.
