It’s a common misconception that you only need 30% to pass matric. But there’s more to it than meets the eye. Here’s a guide to understanding the matric scoring system. Matriculants countrywide are anticipating the release of their final marks. But if you don’t understand the grading system, don’t worry. We have your back.   This is the highest pass you can achieve. This pass also means you can study further at university, based on your APS score (more on that later). The only difference between the bachelor’s pass and the diploma pass is the pass mark difference for the three high credit subjects. See below. A higher certificate pass allows you to further your studies at TVET colleges and certain private colleges in a field of your choice, as long as you meet the admission requirements. This is where the 30% pass mark requirement gets tricky. While it is the bare minimum needed to pass your matric year, you still have to satisfy the minimum subject requirements.   The Department of Basic Education explains that if the pupil does not satisfy the minimum subject requirements, that person will not be awarded the National Senior Certificate, even though he may have attained an exceptionally high mark in one or two of the other subjects. Admission Point Scores (APS) are the marks calculated from your final matric results.  The number of points you get for each of your final matric examination subjects will depend on what percentage you get for each subject. The points get for each subject should then be added up. This total will be your APS and determines whether or not you qualify for admission into university or college. Each university has its own entry requirements and while you can gain entry into a university, it may not be in the field you desire. This is why it is important to research the university before you apply.
