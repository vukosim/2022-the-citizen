KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala’s Cabinet has resolved to retain eight of the province’s struggling municipalities under administration until 30 April. The decision to continue keeping the municipalities under administration, which includes the local municipalities of Msunduzi and Mtubatuba, was taken during a meeting of the Provincial Executive Council this week. Section 139 of the Constitution authorises the provincial executive to intervene in a municipality when it does not fulfill its executive obligation in terms of legislation.

He said the Provincial Executive Council would undertake the necessary assessments review and considerations on the municipalities’ fate at the end of April.  “The Provincial Executive Council believes that the extended municipal interventions are in the best interests of the citizens who are served by these municipalities, and they will benefit from the support of the other spheres of government as prescribed by the Constitution.”  Compiled by Thapelo Lekabe NOW READ: Govt forced to make interventions at 46 crisis-ridden municipalities
