The sad part about this whole situation is that it is not entirely up to him, there are many people involved and the future of the club has to be considered as well. “He has played a number of games and he did quite well even though he got injured at some point. But the arrival of Ndah (Olisa) has made things  difficult for Jele because the club has a young and quality centre-back they can rely on just as it was with Jele when he was younger. Anyway, he is the longest serving player in the current squad and maybe another extension might just be his reward from the club,” said the source.
