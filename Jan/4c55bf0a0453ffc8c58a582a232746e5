A 39-year-old ANC ward councillor was killed after he arrived home in Hammarsdale, KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday evening. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the councillor, Minenhle Mkhize, had just arrived from Unit 6 where he had been playing soccer when the incident happened. “He was still in the white Toyota Hilux with Gauteng province registration number when he was shot several times. He died instantly.  “Seven empty cartridges were found at the scene, the vehicle has been seized for further investigation,” Mbele said.

Mkhize’s brutal murder is one of the latest killings that have plagued KwaZulu-Natal.  Several councillors and ward candidates were murdered last year ahead of the local government elections held in November.  A spate of political killings in the province led to the establishment of the Moerane commission of inquiry by former premier Willis Mchunu. The report, released in 2018, laid the blame at the door of government, political parties and the police, who were found to have weaknesses in law enforcement.
