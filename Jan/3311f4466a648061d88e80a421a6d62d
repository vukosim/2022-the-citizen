It was also recognised that this matter should be resolved as soon as possible before the league draws to an end.  “With that accepted, the DC was inclined to grant the request by Chiefs to have the matter stand down until their arbitration at Safa be finalized.  “The matter was then postponed to the 25th of February at 16:00 hours at which time the matter will proceed. Of course depending on the outcome of the arbitration it may well be that the matter may not proceed in the current format.  “Whatever the outcome may be, we should not preempt it. As matters stand, this matter will again proceed on the 25th of February 2022. Should the arbitration be finalised by then, the prosecutor was directed to communicate with the DC member as to the next course of action, mindful that at this stage no one knows what the outcome of the arbitration will be.  “Until then, I will not be drawn into any running commentary on the matter, however I undertake to keep you posted on the material developments of this as and when they happen,” explained Majavu.
