Supposedly on track to be revealed next month, a slew of new details pertaining to the production version of the long delayed Alfa Romeo Tonale have leaked online. Already delayed twice and not teased by Alfa Romeo since the reveal of the concept at the Geneva Motor Show three years ago, the Tonale is expected to ride on the same platform as the Jeep Compass, but according to a new report from the italpassion.fr blog site, with a completely different range of engines. A topic of much speculation since the concept’s reveal, the publication alleges the Tonale will derive motivation from a choice of three units; a brand-new 1.5-litre turbo-petrol with mild-hybrid assistance, the plug-in hybrid 1.3-litre turbocharged Firefly petrol, a likely turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol and a revised version of the 1.6 Multijet turbodiesel. It is however worth mentioning that the details have not been confirmed officially and should, for now, be taken with a pinch of salt. What is known though is that the powerunits have taken centre stage for being one of the reasons for the model’s delay after performance was branded “unacceptable” by Alfa Romeo boss, Jean-Philippe Imparato, last year.

In Europe, the Tonale will come in Super, Sprint, Ti and Veloce trim levels with reported pricing in Italy from around €28 000 (R492 987). As it already known, a QV model won’t be happening. Production will take place at the Pomigliano d’Arco Plant in Naples with the italpassion.fr article claiming the opening of order books in March followed by the commencing of sales in June. Expect more details, including official material from Alfa Romeo, to emerge over the coming days and weeks.
