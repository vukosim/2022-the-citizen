Malawi striker Gabadinho Mhango will be aiming for another explosive performance for the Flames when they meet Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations Group B clash on Tuesday.ALSO READ: Mhango double keeps Malawi in hunt for historic second-round place The Orlando Pirates striker was the star performer for Malawi in their last game at the tournament, as he scored a brace to help his side comeback from one goal down to win 2-1 against Zimbabwe this past weekend. Having missed out on Malawi’s opening game of the competition which they lost 1-0 to Guinea after testing positive for Covid-19 , the striker’s return to the team was vital for the Flames, as they increased their chances of qualifying for the knockout stages of the continental tournament. “I am very pleased with the performance. It was not an easy match especially when you consider that we had to come from behind. Our teamwork and team spirit is what got us this result and we will approach the next match the same way,” Mhango was quoted on the Pirates website. Mhango, who hasn’t seen much game time for the Soweto giants this season will certainly be a key man for head coach Meke Mwase’s team when they come up against a star-studded Senegalese team, which boasts with one of the best strikers in the world, Sadio Mane, who plays his football for Liverpool FC in the English Premiership. The Lions of Teranga also have some experienced defenders in Abdou Dialo of Paris Saint-Germain in France and Olympiacos center-back Pape Cisse, who will be trying to keep Mhango quiet in the game.
