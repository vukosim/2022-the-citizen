He comes highly rated and is as tall as Mame Niang – do you remember him?  “We are yet to hear who the club might release but they might try and keep everyone because of the tight fixture schedule which includes the Champions League,” said the source.  Phakaaathi has further learnt that the said striker is Abraham Majok who is a 23-year-old from Southern Sudan but also holds an Australian citizenship.  It has also emerged that Usuthu are trying to lure Katlego Otladisa to the coastal side from Marumo Gallants.  Otladisa has been one of the standout performers for Gallants and was reported to have also caught the attention of Kaizer Chiefs earlier in the season.   “His agent met with Gallants management early this week and something could happen before this week ends,” added the source.
