Bafana Bafana and Mamelodi Sundowns defender Rushine de Reuck is said to be on the verge of playing in Europe, should formal discussions with his club Sundowns go accordingly, an insider at the Pretoria-based outfit has revealed.

The former Maritzburg United player is said to have always wished to go back to Europe and play in the top leagues, but, with two more years to his contract at Downs, it remains to be seen if whether or not the club will sell him. “He has been one of the best players in the league in the last year, very consistent and he has also been doing well for Bafana Bafana. I am not really surprised by the interest from overseas teams, it was expected. But, I don’t think Sundowns would want to lose such a quality player,” said the source. “He is one of the best players in the country and you know that Sundowns love quality and they are an ambitious team. So, losing De Reuck would leave a big gap in their squad, plus the club has a long season with the Caf group stages coming up. But, we will see what happens, maybe they (Sundowns) might think otherwise and not stand in the way of a player’s growth by letting him to Europe,” added the source.
