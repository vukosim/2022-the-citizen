Victor Letsoalo’s reported imminent move to Kaizer Chiefs in this transfer window is likely to be blocked by a promise of more money by Royal AM, who are not ready to let go of their hot firing goal-poacher, a source at the KwaZulu-Natal based club has revealed.

But, the insider at Royal is confident that Letsoalo won’t be going anywhere, at least not now with the club valuing him so much and still need him. “People have to be serious, who wants to lose one of their key players during this stage of the season? There is no way that he will be let go. I know that these people (Chiefs) have been trying by all means to get him to join them. But, the club has a strategy when these big teams come, we have a good financial muscle, so, they promise our players money and what the club does is put more money on that offer. “They are not the first ones, especially from Gauteng, there is another team that has been trying their luck with him. Anyway, he still has a contract with the club which expires next year, so I really don’t see him moving. That is unless he has other plans and says otherwise, but, so far, I know he is happy at the team,” said the insider.
