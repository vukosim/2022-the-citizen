Just days after he made headlines for challenging Cassper Nyovest to a boxing match, veteran actor Patrick Shai is in the news once again.  Tabloid Sunday World reported on Saturday that   “I want to bleksem you before I die. I want to make sure that I’ve beaten you up so that on my tombstone, it is written that I am the man who beat Caster or Coster or whatever your sh*t name is… Give me that respect. Come, you son of a bi**h,” he said in his viral video. Fans quickly noted that in referring to Cassper as a “son of a b**ch,” he was essentially calling his mom a b**ch. This prompted Patrick Shai to post a follow-up video apologising to Cassper and social media at large for the insult. He also shared a written statement repeating his apology.  “From the bottom of my heart, I would like to apologise. Apologise, for having [used] such strong language towards your mom. Even though the challenge would have been an ideal thing but it has now been soured by what I said. “I regret every bit of the last sentence I used. I am sorry,” he said.  Shai has appeared in shows such as Soul City, Generations and Zero Tolerance.The Citizen has reached out to Shai’s family for confirmation of the reports and will update the article in due course.  This is a developing story.
