There seems to be some positive news in the Orlando Pirates camp, with Bucs first choice goalkeeper Richard Ofori set to make a return when the DStv Premiership resumes in February. READ ALSO: REVEALED: What’s delaying Sirino’s Sundowns exit Ofori is said to have made quite a huge progress in recovering following his injury, which he sustained during national team duty for Ghana when they took on Bafana Bafana last year in September. His injury has kept him out for close to four months now and he has subsequently missed out on Ghana national call-up for the on-going Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. However, an insider in the Buccaneers camp has shed some light on the come-back of the shot-stopper, who joined Pirates from Maritzburg United back in 2020. “Things are looking good, Ofori has been working really hard so that he can come back fully fit for the remainder of the season. It is not a nice feeling to be out for such a long time, look it also happened to Zakhele Lepasa and now he is back. What I can say is that I am certain that he will be available for selection when the league starts in February,” the source continued. “By the time he got injured he thought he would speedily come back, but it was not the case and he had to understand that. Another thing is that we couldn’t be rushed, you might rush a player and he ends up getting another injury. But everything is going well, he is just disappointed that he is missing the Afcon, but he will be okay and the club’s medical team is doing their best to get him back to his best.” Ofori’s return will surely be welcomed well by Bucs’ co-coaches, Mandla Ncikazi and Fadlu Davids, with a number of players having recovered from their respective injuries towards the end of 2021 with Thembinkosi Lorch, Innocent Maela, Goodman Mosele to mention a few all returning to matchday squad.
