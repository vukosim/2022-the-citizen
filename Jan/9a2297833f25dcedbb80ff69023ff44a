A fifty partnership between Keegan Petersen and Rassie van der Dussen was South Africa’s highlight of the second morning of the third Test against India, with the icing on the cake being that they were unbeaten at lunch, as the Proteas struggled through a tough session to reach 100/3 at Newlands. Petersen was playing with increasing confidence as he went into the break on 40 not out, while Van der Dussen was working the ball around well and was on 17 not out. They came together after South Africa had slipped to 45/3 in a troubled first hour. The hosts had begun the second day on 17/1 and they had not added to their total when Aiden Markram (8) foolishly decided to leave the second ball of the day from Jasprit Bumrah, who bowled one of his trademark booming in-duckers, with Markram being bowled without playing a shot. Nightwatchman Keshav Maharaj occupied the crease for 72 minutes and 45 balls before being bowled through the gate for 24, Umesh Yadav taking his wicket in his second over of the day.

The Proteas were still 123 runs behind India’s first innings total of 223. Bumrah, who dismissed both openers, had taken 2/16 in 11 overs.
