When it comes to public speaking, and upsetting just about anyone without giving much of a f*#k, there are only a few who do it better than Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema, who took a swipe at the Premier Soccer League’s (PSL) decision to keep their doors shut for supporters.

Malema was speaking at a rally in a “Siyabonga” rally in the province of KwaZulu-Natal where they were thanking the people of Durban for casting their votes in the recent local government elections as they were listed as the third biggest part in eThekwini Municipality behind the African National Congress and the Democratic Alliance. The PSL has shut its doors to supporters for about 31 months as the country is still fighting the novel Covid-19 virus, and are not willing to budge until it is safe to do so. The league, however, hosted about 2000 people in the MTN8 final between Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City in October last year. Nonetheless, the league decided to keep their doors closed after that experiment, and this “We call on the leadership of the PSL not to be scared and be cowardice and challenge this government, they must not be seen to be light. Why is the PSL leadership quiet when political parties are busy in the soccer stadiums yet soccer clubs (fans) are not allowed in the stadium. We want our soccer back, we want our entertainment back.” Those are the sentiments of the EFF leader. The PSL has been expected to follow in the footsteps of the South African Football Association, who have been allowing a certain number of supporters in the stadiums for Bafana Bafana games, but the Irvin Khoza led PSL have not shown much intention to take leaf from the country’s governing body.
