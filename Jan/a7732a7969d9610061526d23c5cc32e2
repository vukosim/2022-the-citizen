Things took a dramatic turn at the Metro FM studios after it was reported that they have suspended one of their hosts, Dineo Ranaka.  City Press reported that Dineo was suspended for her participation in the viral Umlando Dance Challenge.  The #UmlandoChallenge, requires you to shake your hips from side to side and up and down in the most random and creative places to hit Amapiano song uMlando. Many people have been enjoying watching these videos mostly done by men.  Dineo recorded her own attempt in the Metro studios and that seems to have not sat well with her bosses. The station viewed her actions as misconduct, as she dances on top of the office furniture, the publication reported.  Dineo is the host of The Bridge which airs between 9:00 and 12:00 on weekdays, she was not on air on Tuesday morning. Dineo’s Umlando Dance Challenge video has been viewed over 430,000 times on Twitter.  The Metro FM communications team did confirm the reports, saying Dineo Ranaka is not scheduled to appear on Metro currently. The Citizen has reached out to Metro FM for further comment and is still waiting for a response.  Former Metro FM presenter Pearl Thusi said she hopes Dineo is okay after her suspension, adding she was glad she left the station a few years ago.  “One of the best things I ever did for my self-esteem and growth was to leave Metro FM. It’s one of the decisions I’m proudest of. I hope Dineo is ok,” she tweeted.  The actress further defended Dineo after some people said her actions were unprofessional, particularly as she did the dance challenge in the office.  Pearl said Metro was the most toxic work environment she ever worked in. The station recently dealt with sexual harassment allegations made by Pearl Modiadie against former station manager Antony “Tony” Soglo.  “I can’t control Dineo’s actions or anyone’s feelings about them – however, Metro is the most toxic environment I’ve ever encountered. That remains regardless of who she is or isn’t,” concluded Pearl.
