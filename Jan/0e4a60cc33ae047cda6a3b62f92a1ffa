Punters need to be on full alert when trainer Dennis Bosch and jockey S’Mango Khumalo team up. The duo has an outstanding one in three winning hit rate this season and the booking of “Bling” on three in-form Bosch runners at Greyville on Wednesday is a chance to capitalise on the chemistry. Very consistent seven-year-old sprinter Hampton Court is their contender in Race 4, a MR66 Handicap over 1000m of the Polytrack. The son of Var will be giving it stick from the start and Khumalo, with his excellent balance and judgement of pace, is just the man to keep him rolling to a fifth career victory. A lack of quality and form among the other runners makes Hampton Court one of the better bets on the day. In the next race, a FM71 Handicap over 1400m, Khumalo gets the leg up on And We Danced, a three-year-old filly he steered to a maiden win in November. She has not been disgraced in two outings since then and re-uniting with her partner in triumph could see her rise to the occasion. The Bosch-Khumalo team’s third runner is Cordobesa in the sixth – more of a long shot but not without a hope. Last time out, her third run after a rest, the three-year-old filly had a troubled passage and finished downfield. Her previous form reveals a trier who could unearth her best under the magic hands of the former champ.
