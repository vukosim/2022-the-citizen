Tshabalala, who is currently club-less after his spell with AmaZulu FC ended in August, has been training on his own and pushing his businesses on the side while waiting to get a new club. “Baroka want him, they really want to sign Shabba. I mean, Shabba is one of the best players that was ever produced in South Africa, plus he is also a good role model. You won’t hear any bad stories about him in the media. So, the guys at Baroka want to sign him to not only be a player, but to be a good role model to the youngsters and be their big brother. He knows that the offer was placed on the table for him, he just has to think about it and sign, I mean, even the money is good,” said the insider.
