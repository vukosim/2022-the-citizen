Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has extended the national state of disaster to 15 February.     The extension has been gazetted in terms of section 27(5)(c) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002 (Act No. 57 of 2002).     “The extension takes into account the need to continue augmenting the existing legislation and contingency arrangements undertaken by organs of state and all other role players to mitigate against the impact of the disaster on lives and livelihoods,” said Dlamini-Zuma in a statement.
