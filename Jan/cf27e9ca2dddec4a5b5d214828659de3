Road users are urged to make regular rest stops, and to rather reach their destinations later than not at all.  Traffic is expected to increase across the country’s major highways as holidaymakers return home from Sunday.  N3 Toll Concession said peak traffic conditions were expected to start on Sunday morning and continue into Monday.  Slow moving traffic and delays are expected, which the N3TC warned could lead to frustration, fatigue and drivers losing focus and concentration.  Long queues have already been reported at the Grasmere toll plaza.  To stay up to date the latest accidents and N3 toll route updates, consult their Twitter page by clicking here.  If you need emergency assistance on the N3 toll route, call the 24/7 helpline on 0800 63 43 57.  Compiled by Nica Richards NOW READ: UPDATE: Children among six killed in N1 Limpopo crash
