A total of 7.841,132 Covid-19 vaccinations have been administered in the province as at 06 January 2022.“All persons 12 years and older are encouraged to visit their nearest vaccination site to receive the jab. It is thought getting 70% or more of the adult population vaccinated that we can minimise the impact of the fourth wave. This will also help us return to the things we love such as attending sporting, cultural, religious and entertainment events of our choice safely,” said the department.  “The public is further reminded that those who received a two-dose vaccine need to return for the second dose at 42 days. All Gauteng sites both private and public accept walk-ins whether people are registered on the EVDS or not. The Department calls on members of the public to continue adhering to nonpharmaceutical interventions by maintaining a safe physical distance, wearing a mask, washing our hands regularly with soap and water or using an alcohol-based sanitiser and avoiding large gatherings.”
