Former Isibaya actress and girl mom Linda Mtoba has stunned the internet with her new, stunning and toned transformed body which she showed off in a series of pictures.  Taking to social media, the 30-year old actress shared a series of pink bikini pictures with her 1.5 million followers, which were taken on the beach during Mtoba’s vacation.  In the caption of the post, Linda expressed how she never wore bikini’s before she gave birth to her daughter, but that she now feels comfortable enough to do so because she has worked hard to achieve her current physique, and feels that she looks better than she did before having a child.  “To think I never wore bikinis before having my beanie pie, BUT NOW I’ve worked hard to get here and I look even better than what I did before I birthed a whole human,” said Mtoba.

It’s not confidence, I look amazing,” said the actress.  In June 2021, Mtoba shared a bikini picture for the first time on social media after overcoming postpartum depression brought on by the birth of her daughter. In the caption of her post, the girl mom shared a letter to herself where she expressed how there were times that she did not feel like herself, and could not connect to the person she was before the pregnancy and birth of her child, but eventually found herself again after working hard to get to know herself again.
