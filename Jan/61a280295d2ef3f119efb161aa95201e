Springbok captain Siya Kolisi and his family are enjoying some downtime at Perivoli Lagoon House in Stanford in the Western Cape to celebrate his wife Rachel Kolisi’s birthday. The skipper took to his Instagram account on Friday to share a short clip of his wife taking a nap. “This is 32. Happy birthday Mariri @rachelkolisi wam [sic],” he captioned the video. Friends and fans took to the comments section to wish Rachel a happy birthday, and to wish Siya luck when his wife wakes up and sees the video of her sleeping on social media. ALSO READ: Unathi comments on her ‘Idols SA’ exit Sue Duminy, who is one of Rachel’s close friends and South African cricketer JP Duminy’s wife, told Siya how evil he was for sharing the video of her friend sleeping, while another follower jokingly told Siya that he will need to be faster than teammate Cheslin Kolbe when Rachel wakes up. Napping wasn’t the only activity on Rachel’s birthday weekend to-do-list. She also hit the gym with Siya on Saturday morning in what looked like a really intense workout. Siya once again took to his Instagram account to share a video of his wife, this time with her permission, and her looking a lot more active, doing burpees while he motivates her in the background. Rachel has been looking amazing after having completed a 25-day challenge in September last year, during which she cut out sugar and meat, did intermittent fasting, one workout a day, drank a minimum of 3L of water per day, and got eight hours of sleep every night. She didn’t stop after that, saying that she felt so good after the challenge, she decided to keep it going.  “I’ve enjoyed it so much, not as strict in some areas, but hanging onto most of the new habits,” she said in an Instagram post. The fit lifestyle definitely agrees with Rachel, and it looks like she and husband Siya are having an absolute jol working out together.
