Double Superlative, winner of the Cape Guineas in December, has been backed into joint favouritism for the WSB Cape Met to be run at Kenilworth on 29 January. Following the sudden retirement of Met defending champion Rainbow Bridge on Thursday, Double Superlative – a two-time winner from five starts – was installed at the top of the betting boards alongside Kommetdieding, winner of the 2021 Durban July and second in last week’s Queen’s Plate. Impressive Queen’s Plate winner Jet Dark is priced at 5-1 for the Met, while Linebacker, who disappointed in that race, is half a point shorter at 9-2. Upcountry supporters of Triple Tiara heroine will be drawn to the 15-1 on offer for her, while the 33-1 about Triple Crown king Malmoos is also unlikely to last.
