Orlando Pirates are said to have exercised their option to extend the contract of their current longest serving player and captain Happy Jele, who is set to be part of the Buccaneers again next season.

Earlier this month, Phakaaathi Mgosi Squad reported that the Mpumalanga born defender was keen to see his stay being extended as he feels he could play for two or more seasons. With his wish now granted, the center-back will be looking to repay the club’s management by putting in a great shift at the back for Bucs for the remainder of the season. And he will also be hoping that he remains injury free after sustaining a couple of knocks last year, which saw him spending some time on the sidelines. Jele joined Pirates back in 2004, with the club being the only professional senior team that he has played for to date. Last year, the Bucs skipper was celebrated for making 400 appearances for the Soweto based club (he is now over 400) and with another season coming up, he could easily get to 500 games for the club, with a number of games they are playing – that is also if they qualify for continental football again. Jele is the second oldest player at Pirates along with Mpontshane, who is his age mate, while goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands is the oldest with the keeper at 38-years old.
