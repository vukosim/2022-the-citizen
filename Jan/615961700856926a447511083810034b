For two weekends in a row, the Stormers have looked down and out on the road, but they have shown the same remarkable resilience to avoid defeat and keep themselves very much in contention to win the South African Shield in the United Rugby Championship. Two weekends back, in Pretoria, they were 26-18 down against the Bulls with just 12 minutes left, but the Stormers scored two brilliant breakaway tries at the death to win 30-26. On Saturday, they were trailing 19-3 after 51 minutes and their scrum was getting mangled against the Sharks in Durban, but they fought back to snatch a 22-22 draw.

I’m not sure what era of Western Province rugby would ever have seen that sort of count before. “To get seven points away from home these last two weeks is really good.” ALSO READ: ‘We just weren’t good enough’: Lions flanker Jaco Kriel The Stormers coach seemed to acknowledge that his side had been outplayed and that, on a normal day, they would have suffered defeat. “It was not a great game from us. We lacked organisation and control and that slowed our game down, until we decided to speed things up a bit in the second half,” Dobson said. “But our game management was poor and the truth is we were lucky. The Sharks were not at their full pomp, but they had enough chances to finish us.”
