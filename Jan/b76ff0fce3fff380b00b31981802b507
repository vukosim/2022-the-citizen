An inquest docket has been opened after two young boys who went swimming in a mine dam in Bronville, Free State drowned.  On Saturday afternoon, a group of boys made their way to the dam, but a 5-year-old experienced difficulties after venturing too deep, eyewitnesses told police.  While struggling to get out of the dam, the boy’s 7-year-old brother tried to rescue him. Both boys then reportedly disappeared, and later drowned.  The incident was reported to police the following day. South African Police Service’s (Saps) diving unit, led by Lieutenant Colonel Conrad Fouche, managed to retrieve the two bodies.  Their next of kin were informed, and they were identified as Nic-Nadio Pienaar, 5, and Marshall Pienaar, 7.  Police urged parents to always know the whereabouts of their children to avoid this type of disaster.
