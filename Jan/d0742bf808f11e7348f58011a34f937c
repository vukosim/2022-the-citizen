Former Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor has been banned from all cricket for three-and-a half years over breaches of the International Cricket Council’s anti-corruption code, the world governing body said Friday. Taylor accepted four charges relating to breaches of the rules and a separate charge of breaching the ICC anti-doping code. “Over such a long career, he (Taylor) participated in numerous anti-corruption and anti-doping education sessions and knew exactly what his obligations were under the ICC anti-corruption and anti-doping codes,” said Alex Marshall, general manager of the ICC’s Integrity Unit. “It is disappointing that a player of his experience chose not to fulfil those obligations. However, he has accepted all charges, which has been reflected in the sanction.” Taylor revealed on Monday in a tweet that he took cocaine and accepted a $15,000 bribe from an Indian businessman.
