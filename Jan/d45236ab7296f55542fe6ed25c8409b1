Staffers at the SABC in Bloemfontein, Free State arrived at work to find walls outside the studios sprayed with graffiti on Sunday. The latest break-in is another security breach at yet another national key point.  The alleged intruder is under guard at hospital after he was shot by SABC security guards. According to sources in Bloemfontein, the walls outside the broadcast studios are covered with graffiti, with one reading “next time there will be a bomb”, and another “I love you Sakina,” purportedly referring to SAFM and SABC TV presenter, Sakina Kamwendo.

This follows consecutive concerning incidents this month alone, namely the blaze that gutted Parliament and burned over two days, and a hammer attack on the Constitutional Court a few days later. Hawks spokesperson Brigadier Thandi Mbambo said the suspect gained entry through the back door. A security guard shot at the man after he attacked him and his colleagues.

He is under police guard as investigators wait for him to wake up. A charge of attempted murder is also being investigated. NOW READ: Safety of judges, staff at Concourt compromised, says Zondo
