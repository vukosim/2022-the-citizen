Genesis Gabrielle Tina Manney, commonly known as Gigi Lamayne has a few tricks up her sleeve for the year 2022, and one of them may be a new pet snake. The 27-year-old rapper took to her private Instagram account to share two videos on her page which feature a snake wrapped around her neck during what seems to be a bikini photoshoot. “Anyway I have a son now and he is super protective,” said Lamayne in the caption of her first post.  In the second video which she posted, she is joined by a producer named Vugar M Beats in the photoshoot, while she tries to keep the snake in position as she poses for the camera.  In the caption of the post, Gigi welcomes in 2022, as well as the snake, and then makes a statement that not all snakes are evil.  In the comments section, fans said the rapper looked scared while holding the snake, and Gigi replied to some comments admitting that she was indeed terrified to be holding and posing with the snake.

At the beginning of the year 2021, the rapper shared some behind-the-scenes shots with her fans and followers from the “Garden of Eden” themed photoshoot she had, and although the shoot was done with the theme of a story from the Bible, fans were concerned to see the 27-year-old rapper posing with a snake.  The posts were later deleted by the hip hop artist.
