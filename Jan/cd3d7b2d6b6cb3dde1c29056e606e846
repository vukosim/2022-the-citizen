The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) has apologised for quoting an article published in a medical journal that alleges possible negative consequences of vaccination on women’s reproductive health. The public statement was issued on 16 January, which the commission has since withdrawn. The withdrawal follows the condemnation by the health department and other experts of the statement.  It was pointed out the commission had not considered all available evidence, nor the benefits associated with the vaccination of women and pregnant women.

Commissioner of the organisation Busisiwe Deyi told 702 the CGE takes full ownership for the “lack of verification in the initial statement.”
