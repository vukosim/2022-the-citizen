A bitterly disappointing performance from the Lions cubs saw them get smashed 50-9 (halftime 24-6) by the Pumas in their Currie Cup clash at Ellis Park on Wednesday afternoon. It looked like a completely different team from the one that fronted up admirably against Western Province on the weekend, as they didnâ€™t learn from any of their mistakes while adding a whole lot more in a disastrous showing. The Pumas took the lead with a 16th minute with a penalty from flyhalf Tinus de Beer. Two minutes later from a Lions attacking scrum on the Pumas 22m line, the hosts knocked on, with the visitors then picking up and kicking ahead for fullback Devon Williams to chase, collect and score under the poles, with the extras moving them 10-0 up. A 28th minute penalty from Vaughen Isaacs then got the Lions on the board, only for the Pumas to hit back just two minutes later as a quick tap penalty in the Lions half from scrumhalf Lucky Dlepu saw him put flank Daniel Maartens into space with him diving over for a converted score. With two minutes to go to the break, Isaacs slotted his second penalty to make it 17-6, only for the Lions to let the Pumas have the final say with a converted maul try to Corne Fourie after the half time hooter, putting them well ahead at the break. The Lions started the second half with the first points through an Isaacs penalty, but it was their last of the match as the Pumas then powered away with four more scores. De Beer stepped his way over in the 45th minute and converted his own score, while replacement prop Simon Raw powered over after a strong maul for an unconverted try in the 65th minute. Further replacements, hooker Llewellyn Claasen and lock Brandon Valentyne, then also crashed over for converted scores for the Pumas in the final 12 minutes to seal a massive win on the road. Scorers Lions Penalties: Vaughen Isaacs (3) Pumas Tries: Devon Williams, Daniel Maartens, Corne Fourie, Tinus de Beer, Simon Raw, Llewellyn Claasen, Brandon Valentyne; Conversions: Tinus de Beer (6); Penalty: Tinus de Beer
