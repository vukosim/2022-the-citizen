They lost slightly by 1-0 in the first game against Equatorial Guinea, before registering a 2-1 victory over Zimbabwe and wrapped the group stages with a goalless draw against Senegal. Despite being knocked out with a score-line of 2-1 by Morocco in the last 16 round on Tuesday, the Malawian head of state feels the team did extremely well and hopes for a brighter future of football in Malawi after they reached this stage of the tournament for the very first time. “Flames, I am personally filled with joy and gratefulness for the remarkable performance you have displayed at the Afcon tournament. You have written a new history of our nation’s football. Although you did not qualify for the next round, you have left all of us feeling very proud of you and with much hope for a brighter future in football,” read Malawi’s president’s message to the squad. “Walk with your heads held high and we wait to welcome you with pride back home.” Malawi’s players did quite well and fought for the team, but the star of the show was definitely the Bucs goal-poacher Mhango, who managed to score all the goals for Malawi at the tournament. He scored three in total, a brace against Zimbabwe and one goal in the tie against Morocco.
