Stuart Pettigrew has been described as an under-rated trainer so often that no racing fans still think of him as that. Particularly in recent months, serious punters have dared not skim over his name in a race card, so in tune has his string been. The Randjesfontein conditioner pumps out excellent stats for a smallish operator: currently a win ratio of near 18% and a place ratio of 37%. This sort of success is drawing ambitious owners to the yard and the quality of horse is rising. One loyal, long-time patron has been Terry Kung, owner of the filly Defender Of Rights, who runs in Race 4, a 1400m Maiden Plate, at the Vaal on Thursday. It is only the three-year-old’s second outing, but the way she performed on debut, over the same course and distance, makes her a standout bet and the obvious exotics banker for the day. Defender Of Rights drew a little betting support 44 days ago, so must have shown potential at home. As is often the case with young girls, she had an awkward start on her first outing and ended up at the back of the field as it hared off up the turf. But there’s no keeping down a smart cookie and she reeled in her rivals and “flew” towards the end – just failing to overhaul winner Full Royalty. With that experience in the bank and a more experienced rider to assist, Defender Of Rights can confidently be expected to go one better.
