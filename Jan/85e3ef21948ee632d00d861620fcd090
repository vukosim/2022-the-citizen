South African singer and songwriter Kelly Khumalo has been struck with grief after the death of her friend and percussionist, Jacob “Teekay” Kotu. Taking to social media, the songstress shared a poster which had information about Teekay’s memorial service to be held on 27 January, as well as a small tribute in the caption of her post to the late musician.  Kelly started off by expressing how difficult Jacob’s passing has been for her, and how his death has brought on an immense amount of pain.  “This I have not come to terms with and I don’t think I ever will, the pain is too much, I know I’m strong but no one prepared me for this,” said the singer.

How do I get on that stage without you,” asked the star. Khumalo ended off her tribute saying that all is well if this is God’s will, and that she will always carry Teekay in her heart.  “Kodwa ke kulungile makuvume wena Jehova. Rest In Peace Ngwana mme I will always carry you in my heart,” said Khumalo.  Teekay made up the other half of the musical group, Rhythmic Elements as a percussionist, but the pair separated and went their seperate ways in 2010.
