He has helped us win four major trophies and has consistently delivered on and off the field of play which is why our Chairman Khulu Sibiya gave his blessing for this move,” Matthews was quoted as saying in a statement issued out by SuperSport. “He has made us proud by representing South Africa from Under 17 to the Under 23 Olympics team and now Bafana Bafana. He was PSL young player of the year and is a fantastic role model for young players to follow in how to manage a professional career in sport. “As a young man he gives generously of his money and his time to the communities from where he grew up. He will remain a special son of our club alongside special names like Kamohelo Mokotjo, Daine Klate, Kermit Erasmus and Ronwen Williams. While we are obviously very sad to lose him as a player, we are delighted for him that he has earned himself a big move to a great club and wish him the best of luck at this crossroads in his career,” Matthews said.
