It’s the Cape Town Met at Kenilworth on Saturday and here’s everything you need to know about the horses that will be in action. Trainer: Justin Snaith Jockey: Bernard Fayd’Herbe Draw: 11 The Met has not been a happy hunting ground for this ageing champion who has twice won the Durban July. Ignore unplaced run last time when lame and will make them all go at best. Lifetime: 26 Runs; 8 Wins; 13 Places. 3 Earnings: R8,980,350. Trainer: Sean Tarry Jockey: Craig Zackey Draw: 5 Front-running Joburg raider. Better over shorter distances, but did place in the 2000m Champions Challenge at Turffontein last year. Not out of it if allowed to dictate at a slow gallop. Lifetime: 37 Runs; 5 Wins; 19 Places. 19 Earnings: R5,433,600. Trainer: Piet Botha Jockey: Corne Orffer Draw: 2 This six-year-old looks totally out of his depth in this contest in which weights carried are determined by age and not ability. On paper he faces a nigh impossible task at the weights. Lifetime: 42 Runs; 9 Wins; 18 Places. Earnings: R524,787. Trainer: Justin Snaith Jockey: S’manga Khumalo Draw: 9 Top Cape trainer Justin Snaith has another champion in this four-year-old, who produced a dramatic late charge to win the recent 1600m Queen’s Plate. Further now but hard to look past him. Lifetime: 11 Runs; 6 Wins; 3 Places. Earnings: R2,081,600 Trainer: Harold Crawford/Michelle Rix Jockey: Gavin Lerena Draw: 1 Top-class four-year-old as he showed when winning last year’s Durban July from a wide draw. No match for JET DARK in the Queen’s Plate but will prefer this 2000m distance. Be there. Lifetime: 9 Runs; 5 Wins; 4 Places. Earnings: R1,984,000. Trainer: Vaughan Marshall Jockey: Grant van Niekerk Draw: 6 One of the best and a close second in last year’s Durban July. Unplaced for first time in career in recent Queen’s Plate, but safest to ignore that blip and now reunited with his usual jockey. Lifetime: 11 Runs; 4 Wins; 6 Places. Earnings: R1,837,750. Trainer: Justin Snaith Jockey: Luyolo Mxothwa Draw: 4 Another budding Snaith star and landed biggest success to date when produced at right time in the recent 1800m Premier Trophy. Much tougher task now but can improve again. Consider. Lifetime: 15 Runs; 6 Wins; 5 Places. Earnings: R643,975. Trainer: Johan Janse van Vuuren Jockey: Warren Kennedy Draw: 10 Joburg challenger and not much inferior to the best. Won his preparatory race for the Met so comes into this contest on a high and will stay well. Should not be far away at the business end. Lifetime: 16 Runs; 6 Wins; 6 Places. Earnings: R921,150. Trainer: Johan Janse van Vuuren Jockey: Keagan de Melo Draw: 7 This smart four-year-old ran well for a long way when sixth in the Summer Cup in November. But the opposition is much stronger now and he’s likely to battle under these weight conditions. Lifetime: 10 Runs; 4 Wins; 4 Places. Earnings: R261,300. Trainer: Candice Bass-Robinson Jockey: Aldo Domeyer Draw: 8 One of the best fillies but now pitted against the best males for the first time. Likely to find a couple too good for her, but she’s still improving and will relish the distance. Don’t write off. Lifetime: 14 Runs; 8 Wins; 4 Places. Earnings: R458,400. Trainer: Justin Snaith Jockey: Anton Marcus Draw: 3 Youngest of the Snaith four and gets chucked in at the deep end here in only his sixth run. But this Guineas winner is promising and three-year-olds have a solid record in the Met. Expect a big run. Lifetime: 5 Runs; 2 Wins; 3 Places. Earnings: R539,600.
