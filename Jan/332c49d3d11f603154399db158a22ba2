Kaizer Chiefs assistant coach Arthur Zwane still believes Amakhosi have a chance of catching Sundowns and beating them to the DStv Premiership title this season.

Chiefs returned to training this week ahead of their first game of the New Year, set for early February against TS Galaxy in the Nedbank Cup last 32. After that, Amakhosi will resume their Premiership campaign on February 15 at Cape Town City. Chiefs currently trail leaders Sundowns by 16 points and if they do have two games in hand, two of those could yet be turned into 3-0 defeats, after Chiefs were charged by the Premier Soccer League for failing to attend matches in December against Cape Town City and Golden Arrows. “Our aim is to push in the league games as well,” said Zwane. “We hope results will be in our favour and we will be there at the end of the season, competing for the number one spot. “That is the ultimate goal for us. It looks out of reach, but we still believe anything can happen. It isn’t over until the fat lady sings.” The Nedbank Cup might be a more realistic target for Chiefs, though they first have to get past a Galaxy team who famously upset Amakhosi in the Nedbank Cup final in 2019. Galaxy are currently rock bottom of the Premiership, but Zwane has been impressed by the impact made by the Rockets’ Serbian coach Sean Ramovic. “We know we are playing a very difficult team, Galaxy have a coach who is doing well, you can see they are playing from the back and trying to connect with the midfield and forwards,” added Zwane. “Their structure looks solid and they are going to be a difficult team to play, but I think we will be equal to the task.”
