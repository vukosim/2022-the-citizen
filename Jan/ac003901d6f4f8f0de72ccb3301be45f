National head coach Mark Boucher has been formally charged over allegations of racism made against him by the Social Justice and Nation-Building (SJN) report, it was revealed on Thursday. Boucher, also a former Proteas star in his playing days, was served with charges under Cricket South Africa’s disciplinary code earlier this week, the day before the ODI series against India began. The SJN report, released in December, accused Boucher of discrimination and using racial slurs relating to former spin bowler Paul Adams’ complaint of the Proteas team using a song referring to him as “a brown shit in the ring” during their fines meetings.

Sources have indicated enquiries are still being made into whether CSA director of cricket Graeme Smith should also be charged, but that matter is complicated by the fact that the former Proteas captain is technically an independent contractor. Lawyers representing several respondents implicated in the SJN report labelled it as “flawed”, with ombudsman Dumisa Ntsebeza admitting his findings were “tentative”.
