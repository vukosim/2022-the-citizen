Violence linked to drug trafficking has been a scourge for Mexico’s Caribbean coast for years. Two suspected drug dealers died in a gun battle at a hotel beach near Cancun in November last year. And in October two tourists from Germany and India were killed by stray bullets during a shootout between drug dealers in Tulum, another town in the same area. Mexico recorded 33,308 murders last year, marking a 3.6% decrease compared with 2020, in a country long plagued by cartel violence. Since 2006 – when the government of then-president Felipe Calderon launched a controversial anti-drug military operation – Mexico has recorded more than 340,000 murders, according to official figures.
