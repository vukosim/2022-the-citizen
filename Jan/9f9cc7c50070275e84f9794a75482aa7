Korean spicy noodles are quickly gaining popularity among spicy food lovers. Samyang Buldak is famous for its “3x times spicy burn” and is a must-try for chilli lovers globally. It is worth noting that the heat on Korean spicy noodles can also be extremely overwhelming, even if you are used to hot and spicy food. A colleague recently joked on Facebook about how you might probably need an exorcist if you can finish the “3x” spicy red packet. If heat is not your thing when it comes to food, there are other varieties of these noodles which are milder and tasty, available online at TakeAlot, at selected stores and Korean grocers.  According to my taste buds, the black bean flavoured Korean spicy noodles in the black packet are the mildest of the lot, followed by the pink packet (carbonara flavoured) and the yellow packet (hot cheesy chicken).  I found that adding meat from sweet and sticky spare ribs to this humble meal is a game-changer. Not only does it blend beautifully with the hot spices, but it makes for a filling and satisfying no-fuss dinner which has become a favourite in our home. Here’s my take on a Korean spicy noodles recipe. Preheat the oven to 200ºC. Pop the spare ribs onto a greased baking tray and cook for 15-20 minutes. For the noodles, boil a cup of water in a medium-sized pot or saucepan. Make sure the water just covers the surface of the Korean spicy noodles. As the water begins to dry out, add the milk, butter, cheese spread and sachet contents and mix.  Some noodles have powdered cheese packets that enhance the flavours, but if you are using the spicy red packets, the added butter and cheese will add to the flavour. Once mixed, cover and set aside. The ribs should be cooked by now. Debone the meat, cut into chunks and add to the Korean spicy noodles with grated cheese and mix well and enjoy! *This recipe was concocted one late and lazy Friday night when it was too late to order dinner on Uber eats and we had to make a plan.
