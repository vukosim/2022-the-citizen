Kaizer Chiefs fans’ excitement that they could land yet another of the most sought-after players on a free has quickly evaporated. Earlier this week reports emerged claiming that SuperSport United’s Sipho Mbule is free to sign a pre-contract with any club of his choice as he is on the last six months of his current deal at Matsatsantsa.

Sipho is NOT free, unless Supersport do not exercise the option, so he CANNOT sign a pre-contract”.
