Afrikaans actress, presenter and influencer Angelique Gerber is often seen posing in pink, but it’s when she wears cerise pink that pictures in her profile pop. The redhead, who is married to former Springbok loose forward Jacques Potgieter has been spotted sporting various cerise pink outfits – from a cerise pink dress and swimsuit to a flowy cerise pink dress from the official Miss South Africa sponsor for 2021/2022, ZOËT SA. The mom of three was seen wearing a “hot pink” mini dress in December, coupling it with rugged looking black boots. In January, husband Jacques Potgieter approved of her summer look on Instagram, by commenting with four red hearts.  In the post, Angelique wears a cerise pink one piece swimsuit, playfully posing like a model in a kiddies’ swimming pool at Bronkhorstspruit Dam.
