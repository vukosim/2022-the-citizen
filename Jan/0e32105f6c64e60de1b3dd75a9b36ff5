The recent signing of Bradley “Surprise” Ralani by Mamelodi Sundowns, who acquired the services of the playmaker from Cape Town City, may be an indication that the Brazilians are increasingly ready to let go of Gaston Sirino.ALSO READ: Sundowns defender attracts interest from EuropeHowever, Phakaaathi has learned that Sirino’s attitude at the club is making them increasingly unwilling to abide by the Uruguayan’s desire to leave.Sirino has done his best to get in the bad books of the coaches and the club’s management, as he has been pushing for a move away from the club, making his desired destination no secret either.The Uruguayan attacking wizard wants to reunite with Pitso Mosimane at Al-Ahly and Downs have thus far been having none of it.Phakaaathi has it on good authority that Sirino’s behaviour at Choorklop has not gone down well.At times, when the player was missing from the starting line-up, not among the substitutes or even in the stands – it was because Sirino would allegedly miss training.And if he did show up, he would drag his feet, hoping he would get his way and a source close to the situation at Chloorkop hinted that Sirino may be given a taste of his own medicine.“Sirino has many years left on his contract, he has been an asset to the club since he arrived here in 2018. But if a player starts to throw his weight around and feel he can bully the team into doing what is best for him ahead of the interests of the club…he does not know what is coming for him,” said the source, who suggested that the 30-year-old could be kept until his contract runs out in about four-and-a-half years.Sundowns, meanwhile, are still believed to be in the market for SuperSport United midfield duo Teboho Mokoena and Sipho Mbule, though Matstatsantsa CEO Stan Matthews has already said Mokoena is only likely to move overseas.
