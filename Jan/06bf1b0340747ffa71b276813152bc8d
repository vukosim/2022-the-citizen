Former Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns winger George Lebese is said to be stressing about not finding a team and he is not sure why teams don’t want to sign him and that someone is trying to end his career. READ ALSO: Swallows alleged to have failed to pay December salaries Lebese, whose career has been on a downfall since he came back into the country after his spell with Switchback FC early in 2021. The former Amakhosi player has not been able to find a team since then with trials at Swallows FC and Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila not going his way. A source close to the winger says Lebese thinks that someone in football is trying to sabotage him and they don’t want to see him playing in the Premier Soccer league again. “Lebese’s situation is very bad, I really don’t know why he is not able to get a team because he is a very talented guy, everyone know s that. He would fit in any team in the PSL, I am not even talking about the GladAfrica Championship. So, when he speaks about football, he speaks about people not wanting to see him play. “He says they want to see him fail and that makes him hate football, because there are lots of people who have a very huge influence but you won’t even hear or see them in the papers or TV. They are just doing things on the background,” said the source.
