One of the good things that the DStv Compact Cup has done is to bring players from different teams together and such is the case for Baroka FC shot-stopper Oscarine Masuluke, who says he has built good relationships with the guys in Coastal United FC.ALSO READ: Baroka snap up young striker from rivals Gallants Costal consists players from clubs such as Cape Town City FC, Stellenbosch FC, Chippa United FC and Baroka, who are based in Limpopo. Masuluke says Stellenbosch FC captain Robyn Johannes and Taariq Fielies of Cape Town City have been good mates to him and he is impressed by their play. “I have built good relationships with the guys from different clubs, which is very good for anyone. Especially Johannes and Fielies, they have been very good to me and we have built a good relationship together. They are very good people and whenever I go to Cape Town, I have people who can show me around,” said Masuluke. “It’s a pity that Johannes got a red card and that he won play in our last game, he has shown great leadership skills and to have someone like that in your team is very good, because it keeps the guys on top of their toes. I am sure we will miss him, but again, there are other guys in the squad that can do the job for the club.” Ahead of their final clash with Warriors FC at the FNB Stadium on Saturday, Masuluke expects a very tough game, but is itching to lift the trophy with Costal United. “We saw them play, they are very good, the fans have selected a very good team. It will definitely be a tough game, very tough, I think for both teams. Because we also have quality in the team and we are going out there because we want to be the first to win the trophy.”
