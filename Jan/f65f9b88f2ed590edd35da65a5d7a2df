Luna Escape is an ornery critter, but she can run when she puts her mind to it. Punters looking for a banker on an awkward card at Greyville on Wednesday will be giving the Michael Roberts-trained filly close consideration and hoping she can keep calm and focus on 1100m of galloping in Race 6. Luna Escape showed her liking for the Polytrack when she scooted to a five-length victory on the surface over a similar trip in late November. That was only her second start and she was reported to have been “stubborn” in the prelims. Hammering rivals after expending lots of nervous energy indicates plenty of natural ability. The daughter of Master Of My Fate had a calamitous debut on the Scottsville turf two months earlier, acting bolshy, starting sluggishly, ducking and getting bumped. Rider Rachel Venniker got through that fandango unscathed and got Luna Escape’s mind sufficiently on the job to dramatically improve her performance next time out. The star apprentice is back for more and you’d guess she and the filly have a fairly good understanding of each other by now.
