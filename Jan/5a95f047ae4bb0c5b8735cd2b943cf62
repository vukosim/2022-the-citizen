Reginald Ndima, the Speaker of the Amajuba District Council, was shot dead outside his home in Newcastle, in KwaZulu-Natal, in the early hours of Saturday morning. By the time Ndima arrived at the hospital, he had succumbed to his wounds. Ndima, an Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) member, was elected speaker of the council at the end of November after the local government elections. “Ndima was one of the longest-serving councillors,” the district’s mayor, Vuselwa Bam, told SABC News. “Ndima will be remembered as someone who shared his knowledge with younger councillors and who worked tirelessly for the people of the district,” Bam said. “My deepest sympathies go out to the family of the deceased, people of Amajuba District, the Amajuba District Municipality and all those who were close to councillor Ndima. May God give you the comfort and peace that you seek and may the soul of your loved one rest in peace,” said Bam. He was described as a humble person by the IFP’s spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa. “Councillor Ndima was a humble and responsible servant of the people who diligently dedicated his life to public service,” Hlengwa said. “His sudden death is a loss for the people who he served with integrity for 15 years as a councillor.” The IFP also said it was concerned about the continued killing of public representatives without justice ever being served.
