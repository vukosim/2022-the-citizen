South African hip hop fans have joined forces across many social media platforms to wish Kiernan “AKA” Forbes a blessed and happy 34th birthday.  AKA’s 6-year-old daughter, Kairo Forbes is amongst the people who have sent her father a sweet birthday message. The 6-year-old fashionista took to her personal Instagram page to share an adorable video of herself and her father doing an elaborate dance routine which seemed to have been led by the young dancer.  “I love you to infinity and beyond. Happy birthday Dada,” said Kiaro in the caption of her post.  AKA also took to his own personal Instagram page a few hours into his birthday to post a throwback picture of himself in his younger days, when he was still in school.  Many South African artists as well as fans of the Victory Lap star took to the comments section to send him well wishes on his birthday, and to wish him a long and prosperous life.
