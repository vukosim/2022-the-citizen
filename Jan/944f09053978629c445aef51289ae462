Warriors coach Dylan Kerr lauded the initiative by the DStv Premiership sponsors and the Premier Soccer League (PSL), and says it has allowed football fans in the country to be part of the game since they only get to watch matches at home due the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “This is a really good initiative by the sponsors (DStv), more especially if you consider the fact that fans have not been in the stadium for a very long time due to the pandemic. This has allowed them to be a part of the team and more importantly, have a say and influence on the game” said the Warriors coach. Meanwhile, Coastal United skipper Nodada says it is vital for the players to give their all during the tournament in order to show appreciation to the supporters who believed in them by voting for them to be in the teams. “It is important for us to give the fans the respect that they deserve and this can only be through displaying good performances. All the players that have been selected are here because fans made the effort of voting. This simply means that each and every player that is here cannot afford to take this competition lightly”, said Nodada. “It is also quite encouraging that all the players are present in camp are indeed raring to go on Saturday” he added.
