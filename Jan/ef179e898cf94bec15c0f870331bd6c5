The insurgency began about three years ago and has killed over 3,000 people and displaced nearly 800,000 people in the northern Mozambican province. Cabo Delgado is one of the poorest regions in the country, ranked in the bottom 15 countries in the UN Human Development Index for poverty over the past 10 years. In March 2021, insurgents attacked the coastal town of Palma, killing dozens of people and triggering an exodus that included employees from the Total project, forcing the company to halt work on a $20-billion natural gas project. Rwanda and southern African regional forces deployed to support the Mozambican military in July. Last month, a South African soldier died during an insurgent ambush during operations in Cabo Delgado.
