Head of Gumtree Property Operations, Barrie Swart, said many luxury homes have been listed before and that there is currently a surplus.  “There are several multi-million properties up for grabs at the moment,” he said.  “Covid-19 has impacted uber-wealthy homeowners as well – many are unable to travel to their luxury homes around the world during the current climate, and others are concerned about the volatility of the market,” he added.  However with the nature of these types of listings, particularly at this price, it takes time to find the right buyer to sell the property to.  “It may not seem like it to us, but the Gatsby is a real bargain at this price and will definitely be swept up soon,” Swart concluded.
