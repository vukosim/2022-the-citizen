Over time, your pots and pans start to look crusty and old, and if you are a little clumsy while you cook and forget to regularly check on your pots to ensure that that they are still cooking well, then your meals might also appear to be burnt.  Most times, it is ideal to just throw out your old pots and replace them with new ones, but sometimes if the damage is not too bad, then it may be cheaper to clean and repair your rusty and burnt pots and pans to get them looking relatively new.  Home hacks queen Carolina McCauley has shared her hack on how she cleans pots and pans which she has burnt while trying to prepare a meal for herself and her family.

She then leaves the dishwasher tablet as well as the hot water in the pot for 30 minutes to soak off the crust as well as the burnt scrum which is stuck to the pot. After 30 minutes, Carolina throws out the water into the drain, before using a dish cloth to wipe away the softened burnt scrum which is no longer stuck to the pot.  Another effective way to clean and repair burnt pots and pans is to make use of apple cider vinegar.  Taking to TikTok, Brenna Lee Lindsey has shared a video on her hack on how she uses apple cider vinegar and dish washing liquid to clean her rusty and burnt pots. She first fills the pot with some vinegar, and then adds some dishwashing liquid before mixing the solution together. She leaves the solution in the pot to soak for some time, and then pours it out later to find that the solution has dissolved and broken down the rust that was stuck on the pot.
