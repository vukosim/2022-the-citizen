The Court has ruled that alleged parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe’s referral to Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital was unlawful. The case was heard at Cape Town Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. Mafe’s lawyer Senior Counsel Advocate Dali Mpofu represented him in absentia to argue that the move to send him for psychiatric evaluation was unlawful. This after state prosecutors produced a document from a district surgeon which stated that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. Mafe’s lawyers argued that his committal to Valkenberg was unlawful and unconstitutional. They wanted him out of immediately. Last week, Mafe made his second court appearance where a charge of terrorism was added against him. The Contravening of Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act charge has brought the number of his charges to six.
