South Africa have made it through to the quarterfinals of the U-19 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies, but they are going to have to be at their best to avoid elimination as they take on one of the most impressive teams in the competition, England, at North Sound, Antigua on Wednesday.

But South Africa are going to need to repeat a similar batting effort in the playoff clash starting at 4pm (SA time) on Wednesday, against a stronger England attack that is led by a potent left-arm paceman in Joshua Boyden, while leggie Rehan Ahmed will test their abilities against spin.

He generally bats No 3 for England and South Africa have two ferocious fast bowlers in Liam Alder and Matthew Boast, who will want to get Prest in against the swinging new ball. England, of course, are able to throw some serious cash at their U-19 programme, but what the South Africans lack in rands, they have been making up for in enthusiasm.
