Mamelodi Sundowns are believed to be finally prepared to lose sensational midfielder Gaston Sirino with both Orlando Pirates and Al Ahly said to be salivating at the thought of landing the diminutive Uruguayan.

His current deal ends in 2024 but the club is now willing to listen if there is anyone else interested in him. I have heard that Al Ahly have renewed their interest in him.  “But he could just switch sides in the DStv Premiership with Orlando Pirates also having made themselves an option should he be no longer needed at Sundowns. I think a loan deal could be reached before the end of the current transfer window,”  said the source.  And given the bad blood that has developed between Sundowns and Al Ahly in recent years – or since Pitso left Sundowns – it is almost impossible that Sirino will be allowed to move to Egypt.
