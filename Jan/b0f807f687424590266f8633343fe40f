South Africa has 79,177 active cases of Covid-19, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, has announced.  The country has reported 3,520 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, which brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases to 3.576 379.  This increase represents a 10.0% positivity rate.  The majority of new cases today are from Gauteng Province (25%), followed by Western Cape (21%). KwaZulu-Natal accounted for 15%; Limpopo accounted for 11%; Eastern Cape, Free State, Mpumalanga and North West each accounted for 6%; and Northern Cape accounted for 5% of today’s new cases. “Due to the ongoing audit exercise by the National Department of Health (NDoH), there may be a backlog of COVID-19 mortality cases reported. Today, the NDoH reports 103 deaths and of these, 10 occurred in the past 24 – 48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 93,949 to date,” said the NICD.  21.968,562 tests have been conducted in both public and private sectors. There has been an increase of 163 hospital admissions in the past 24 hours. The average number of daily Covid-19 cases passed a record three million globally this week, while deaths surged for a second week in a row. Here is a state of play based on AFP’s database. The number of average daily cases leapt to a record 3.1 million this week to Thursday, an increase of 11 percent compared to the previous seven days according to an AFP tally. However the upsurge was less marked than in previous weeks, when the highly contagious Omicron variant began its rampage. The confirmed cases only reflect a fraction of the actual number of infections, with varying counting practices and levels of testing in different countries. The week’s main upsurge took place in Asia — particularly in India — where the number of daily cases increased by 57 percent. There was also an increase of 36 percent in the Latin America-Caribbean zone and the Middle East, which was up 32 percent. However, there was a let up in areas were Omicron appeared first, with cases falling by a tenth in Africa and six percent in the United States and Canada. Although infections increased by nine percent in Europe, this was still at a slower pace than previous weeks. Oceania also saw an improvement with cases down by almost a third.
