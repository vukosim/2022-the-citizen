It’s still a work in progress,” Khumalo was quoted on the Chiefs website. “One of the highlights of the game was 15-year-old Vilakazi scoring the goal at the end of the game. Another highlight of the game was us also getting our defense on point. We defended properly today (Sunday).” With Chiefs registering their second victory in a row, Khumalo added that he needs his players to remain consistent and not get big headed. “We are playing Sekhukhune at home next, with young players 17-18 years old. They must not get carried away. We want to continue with the run, let’s see how it goes.”Next up for Khumalo’s charges is a clash against Sekhukhune United at FNB Stadium on Saturday.
