Many fans congratulated the actress on her new role as people cant wait to see her on the screen again.  In November 2021, the media personality tried to get Queen Sono renewed for a new season. It came as a surprise to some that the show wasn’t given another season. It was a Netflix Africa original, created by comedian and director Kagiso Lediga. It was cancelled due to filming difficulties as confirmed by the streaming service. The nature of Queen Sono required shoots on location in various countries across the world. With the ever-present threat of the coronavirus and the travel bans instituted to curb the spread of the disease, this proved difficult for a new season.
