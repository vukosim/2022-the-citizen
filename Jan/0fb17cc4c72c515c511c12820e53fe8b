For a show that started over a decade ago, one would think that Big Brother was past its sell-by date but if trending topics are anything to go by, that is not the case for Big Brother Mzansi.  The latest season of the local version of the international smash hit has captured the imaginations of many around the country since its debut last weekend, and both the hashtags #BBMzansi and #BigBrotherMzansi have enjoyed the top two spots respectively.  Fan favourites have already emerged from this year’s cohort of housemates. The first was sangoma Mpho Wabadimo, who was quite the social media sensation prior to entering the house, and tattoo artist Themba.

Take a look at what fans had to say about Big Brother Mzansi and their favourites.  Big Brother Mzansi is the modern version of Big Brother South Africa, which first aired in South Africa in 2001. The live shows back then were hosted by TV legends Mark Pilgrim, Gerry Rantseli (now Gerry Elsdon) and Zuraida Jardine. After 13 years, the show rebranded as Big Brother Mzansi, with Radu in the driver’s seat as the show’s host. Actor and presenter Lawrence Maleka is the new face billed to usher in a new era of Big Brother, which unveiled an interesting set of housemates on Sunday evening.
