In a statement issued after the Premier League board postponed the match, Leicester said Sunday: “The decision came after the football club confirmed that it had an insufficient number of first-team players available to fulfil the match due to COVID-19 cases, injuries and players on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations.    “The fixture will now be rearranged again for a future date…The club regrets the inconvenience this may cause for supporters of both Leicester City and Everton.” The game was originally due to be played on December 19 but was shelved due to a Covid outbreak at Leicester. Explaining its decision, the Premier League said it accepted Leicester’s call for a postponement as the club does not have the required number of players available for the match (13 outfield players and one goalkeeper).
