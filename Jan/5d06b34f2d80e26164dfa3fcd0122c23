Rain in Johannesburg has delayed the second Test between the Proteas and India at the Wanderers on Thursday. South Africa are chasing 240 in their second innings to win the second Test and level the series at 1-1 after India won the first Test at Centurion. The third Test is in Cape Town next week. ALSO READ: Proteas’ second Test hopes and possible glory rest with captain Elgar Dean Elgar and his team were 118 for two wickets at the close of play on day three on Wednesday. Elgar was 46 not out and with him at the crease was Rassie van der Dussen. The two men dismissed were Aiden Markram and Keegan Petersen. The enthralling match was evenly poised, with India needing eight wickets on a lively pitch to win their first series in South Africa. While rain had fallen in Joburg for much of the week, it had come in the early hours of the morning or late evening. While the forecast for Thursday suggested there would be thundershowers throughout the day, light persistent rain had prevented the fourth day’s play from starting at 10am. The match should however still produce a winner, with day five on Friday – should there be no play on Thursday.
