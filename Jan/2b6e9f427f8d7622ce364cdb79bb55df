According to a source, Swallows are looking at bringing the midfielder on loan and they hope their good relationship with Chiefs will see them securing Radebe’s services. “Well, I know that there have been some people at Swallows who have enquired about his services before. It’s been a while since he has been monitored, along with Given Thibedi. Luckily, Thibedi was able to join Swallows, but now bringing Radebe to Swallows is the next big task for the management at the club. “I am not really sure if Chiefs will let him go, even on loan because he is one of the top gems coming from their development structures. They let go of Thibedi, which was a very big issue, so we will see if it will be the same with Radebe,” said the source.Meanwhile, as previously reported, a source at Chiefs, has revealed that Nigerian shot-stopper Daniel Akpeyi has been offered an extension to his contract and the keeper is more than happy with what the club has offered him in terms of remuneration.  The former Chippa United goal-minder is coming to the later stages of his spell with Amakhosi, with his contract ending in June, giving him the right to talk to any potential clubs this month.
