The Australian founder and global head of Pentecostal megachurch Hillsong announced Sunday he will step down while he faces trial over charges he covered up his father’s child sexual abuse. Pastor Brian Houston said Hillsong’s lawyers had advised him to hand over leadership of the church during his criminal trial. Houston was charged in August 2021 with concealing information from police about alleged child abuse by his father, Frank, who was also a pastor and died in 2004. This is a modal window.

Founded by Houston and his wife, Bobbie, in Sydney in the 1980s, Hillsong has grown into a global megachurch which claims an average weekly attendance of 150,000 people. The church is known for its concert-style services that feature pop music and high-profile special guests, including Justin Bieber and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Houston’s criminal trial is expected to take up most of 2022 with pastors Phil and Lucinda Dooley stepping in to lead the church.
