Various stories were shared on social media of the couple’s nuptials over the weekend, which occurred in Shepstone Gardens, at Mountain View, in Johannesburg. There were several guests at the beautiful venue, with Theo’s band member Nhlanhla Nciza and The Real Housewives of Johannesburg star Brinnette Seopela in attendance.
