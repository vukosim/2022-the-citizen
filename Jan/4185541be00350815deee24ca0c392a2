It seems many of our favourite products, well for some people at least, are being pulled off the shelves – and fish paste is next on the chopping block.  It was announced this week by Pioneer Foods that their Peck’s Anchovette and Redro fish pastes will be discontinued.  Pioneer Foods is the local distributor of Peck’s and the manufacturer of the South African version of Redro. The company said these products will not be restocked for the foreseeable future in the country, Business Insider reported.  The reason for this is due to an ongoing review that has been communicated to customers. They further stated that they have stopped production and sale-related items of the fish pastes in December 2021.

Some commentators said fish pastes are rarely finished once opened.  The past two years have seen the likes of Simba tomato flavour chips, Lays Salt & Vinegar chips and Nestlé Chocolate Log bow out.  Just in August 2021, Simba’s voting campaign surprised many when the results showed that between these three flavours – cheese & onion, tomato sauce and salt & vinegar, tomato received the least votes.  Simba ran a four-month-long voting and buying campaign for three of their flavours, with cheese & onion receiving the most votes.  At the start of the process, salt & vinegar was leading its competitors. However, surprisingly, cheese & onion won with 44.99%, of the nearly 850,000 total votes. Salt & vinegar received 37%, whilst tomato sauce only received 18.01%. Nestlé cleaned house on their chocolate range introducing Kit Kat Chunky Salted Caramel and Nestlé Chunky White. Milky Bar Double, Bar One Peanut and Milky Bar Peanut were discontinued in August 2020.  Just like Pioneer Foods, Nestlé said they were influenced by consumer feedback when they made the changes.
