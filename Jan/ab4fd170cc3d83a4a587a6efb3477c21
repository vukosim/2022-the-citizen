The R1 million nightclub bill pastor, Zimbabwean Passion Java, is making headlines again, this time after challenging South African music heavyweights to brush up on their bible studies for a chance to win R2 million. During his recent trip to South Africa, the flashy pastor posted a video of himself challenging Master KG, AKA, Cassper Nyovest, and DJ Maphorisa to a bible verse challenge. If you recall, Java first caught the attention of Mzansi when he picked up the R1.3 million bill at a nightclub in Pretoria.  The picture of the bill showed the majority of the costs were for booze, particularly from champagne brand Ace of Spade Rose.

He wrote on his Instagram post that the bible verse challenge will start a week later, and the questions will put the musician’s knowledge of bible verses to the test.  The questions are easy and the video is done in a light and humorous manner.  It has been over a week since the announcement of the challenge and Java has not followed up with more videos of this proposed challenge.  It’s likely that the controversial pastor posted the video as a joke, as local celebrities haven’t entertained it.   People said in the comments section that in South Africa the Hawks “don’t play” insinuating that the pastor’s lavish lifestyle is being watched by authorities.  People have questioned what Java’s stream of income might be.  He is a prophet and CEO of Kingdom Embassy Church in Zimbabwe. Java also founded the music label Passion Java Records.  His other titles include being a socialite and a book author.
