AmaZulu FC are not happy with how Kaizer Chiefs poached their star player Siyethemba Sithebe, breaking the rules in the process. Usuthu president Sandile Zungu alleged that Amakhosi spoke to Sithebe before the transfer window opened in January.

I spoke to Bobby Motaung about this and I told him I was not happy with their conduct,” Zungu said on Thursday.  It was not the first time Chiefs poached an AmaZulu player as they did the same with Sibusiso Mabiliso last season, signing him behind Usuthu’s back. But at the time the player was allowed to speak to a team of his choice as he was on the last six months of his deal at the Durban side.  Zungu also revealed that Amakhosi tried to negotiate for an early release of Sithebe by offering them two players but they declined.  “We were offered two players by Kaizer Chiefs, and we made it very clear that we  are not a dumping ground for rejects. Ja we were offered but we looked at the players that they were offering and we said no. “We don’t know when they need the player, but if they need him in this January transfer window they know what should happen. The other two players we rejected, we don’t need them. I won’t mention their names, they may be good for other teams but they are not good enough for AmaZulu. “We are not a dumping ground for other team’s rejects, AmaZulu of old and AmaZulu of today – our brand is very important and we need to protect it,said Zungu.  According to reports that emerged this week, Chiefs will make a final bid for Sithebe by offering Dumisani Zuma and some money, but judging by Zungu’s tone, that is also unlikely to succeed. Usuthu coach, Benni McCarthy meanwhile said he expects Sithebe to train everyday and to give his best until his last day at the club.
