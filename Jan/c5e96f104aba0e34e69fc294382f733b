Losing belly fat is an obsession shared by women worldwide, with many resorting to starving themselves for weeks or following the most outrageous diets. The allure of a trim, toned waist is completely understandable – who doesn’t want to show off their svelte figure on Instagram while strutting the beach or hitting the club? Losing belly fat, however, takes a lot of discipline and dedication, but it is absolutely worth it when you put on your bikini and bask in the admiring glances of your friends.

It’s the first thing we do when 1 January rolls around, we find some crazy detox diet online that promises amazing weight loss results within seven days. While it is true that you can lose up to 4kg (sometimes more depending on your weight) in that amount of time, the reality is that you can’t sustain that eating plan for a long period of time, which means you will eventually revert back to your old eating habits, picking up the weight you had ‘lost’. When you detox, you often eliminate or reduce high-calorie, low-nutrition foods such as carbs, sugar and processed foods, which helps to reduce water weight, but not necessarily fat weight. A detox is great to get your body in the fat burning zone and to kickstart your weight loss journey, but it shouldn’t be the only step you take. Once you have completed your detox plan, whether you followed it for three days or seven days, you should follow a healthy, balanced diet and a moderate exercise plan to maintain the weight loss from your detox.
