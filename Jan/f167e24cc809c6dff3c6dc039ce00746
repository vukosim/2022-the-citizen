The Bulls have secured the services of former stalwart front row forward Werner Kruger as a coaching consultant, tasked to work with the team’s props. The 36-year-old former Springbok was, up until his retirement from rugby last year, one of the most experienced tighthead props having been capped well over 100 times each for the Bulls in Super Rugby and the Currie Cup before adding another century of caps at Welsh club, Scarlets, where he ended his playing career. “We are pleased to have been able to call on Werner Kruger as a consultant who will work with our front row, with immediate effect,” confirmed Bulls director of rugby, Jake White, on Tuesday. “Werner was one of the most respected tighthead props, not only in South Africa, but overseas as well where he became a legend at Scarlets in Wales. He is somebody who knows the Bulls culture intimately and his expertise will be of great value to our group of props currently. “We look forward to seeing his influence and have no doubt that with his contribution we are bound to see an improvement from our front row, particularly the props.” Kruger’s playing career at the Bulls began in 2003, spanning until his move to Wales in 2016, where he remained committed to Scarlets in Llanelli until last year. He was part of the SA Under-21 team for two years in 2005 and 2006 before his selection for the Emerging Springboks team in 2010. Kruger earned four Springbok caps between 2011 and 2012.
