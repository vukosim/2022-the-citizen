The application and implementation also in the matches,” said the young Bucs’ mentor. “It’s very encouraging and to see the boys going all the way to win eight games in a row it’s a motivation. This will keep on going all the way until anyone stops us. We are not being big headed, but we just want to make sure that our preparation and planning continues to give us positive results. We are not going to stop, we will always do the right things and we will not undermine oppositions because we know we still have a long way to go before the end of the season. But we will take each game as they come. “The focus of the boys is always there and we have to make sure that we rotate the squad so that we don’t get fatigued, injuries, bookings and we just want to make sure that the boys do a good job.” The season is indeed far from over, and Qhogi will undoubtedly be looking for another excellent display when they host TS Galaxy at the Rand Stadium on Saturday.
