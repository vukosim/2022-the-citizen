Trainer Mike de Kock is trucking five horses from his Randjesfontein yard to Durban this week to try them out on the Polytrack. If all of them take to the surface as expected at Wednesday’s Greyville race meeting, local trainers will be left scratching around for leftovers. All five have shown potential, if not prodigious talent, so De Kock’s strategy of giving them every chance to be the best they can be for their owners is to be commended. The De Kock show starts early, and bookmaker ante-post betting indicates the master could already have notched four wins by the time Race 5 rolls around. Daredevils might even consider an all-MdK All To Come to kick off the day. Perhaps the most likely winner among this quartet is Sequioa in Race 4, a MR67 Handicap over 1600m. This nicely bred colt won at the third attempt, on the Turffontein Inside turf, but struggled to finish off his next two races, which were on the more demanding Standside course. His sole victory and his manner of running on the flank of the pace suggests he will thrive on Durban’s tight Polytrack. In the third race, the De Kock team sends out Maria’s World, who was a runner-up to a rank outsider at the Vaal last week. She is in good nick, enjoys racing and is overdue a maiden win.
