BEST BET RACE 1 NO 6 PEUT ETRE MOI It is Cape Town Met day with a card of 12 races and punters can build up a kitty for some of the bigger races later on the card with a good win bet on Justin Snaith’s runner. There could not have been an unluckier loser than this filly last time as she ot too far back from a wide draw and flew up late to finish a close second. With S’manga Khumalo up and a better draw, she should be very hard to beat this time. RACE 2 SWINGER: NO 1 STEINBECK AND NO 8 GENTLEMAN JOE These two runners stand head and shoulders above the rest of their rivals and should fight out the finish. Hopefully one can take a nice share of money won in the first race and double it up in Race 2. VALUE BET RACE 5 NO 7 CLIFF TOP – EACHWAY Port Elizabeth-based trainer Alan Greeff has had good success bringing juveniles to contest this race and there is a lot of talk for his charge this year. He was well supported to win on debut over 800m but spoilt his chances by losing ground at the start. He finished second behind Cruise Control, a two-year-old highly rated by Gavin Smith and is also running this time. However, Cliff Top is 3kg better off this time and should reverse the placings. He was originally available at odds of 16-1 but that has been snapped up and he is now trading at 8-1.
