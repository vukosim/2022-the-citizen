Unveiled just under two years ago as one of it’s most controversially styled new models, BMW has confirmed South African market pricing of the all-electric iX, in addition to debuting the performance iX M60i at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Joining the erstwhile i3 as only the second ever all-electric BMW model to be sold in South Africa, the iX forms part of Munich’s Vision iNEXT programme and mirrors the international models by being offered in two guises. Made largely out of aluminium as well as carbon fibre reinforced plastic, the iX slots-in between the X5 and X6 despite being a model of its own, with power in the entry-level xDrive40i coming from a 70 kWh battery. Somewhat surprisingly though, output has been reduced for South Africa from 270 kW to 240 kW with the claimed range being 425 km. Utilising a dual electric motor setup on each axle as evident by the xDrive moniker, the 40i will get from 0-100 km/h in 6.1 seconds with charging time of 11 hours plugged into the 11 kW wallbox BMW will install without cost at the buyer’s home.

Aside from sporting the same incitements as its sibling, the main drawing card of the top-spec xDrive 50i is more power and uprated performance. While equipped with the same dual-motor setup, the 50i features a larger 100 kWh that translates to an output of 385 kW.  An increase of 15 kW over the European equivalent, the 50i will get from 0-100 km/h in 4.6 seconds and run out of charge after 630 km. In terms of pricing, the 40i retails from R1 650 000 and the 50i from R2 175 000 with both sticker prices including a five-year/100 000 km maintenance plan and a battery warranty of eight-years/100 000 km. Representing what BMW calls the next step of its mentioned electrification programme, the M60i debuts as not only the new flagship iX, but also the brand’s most powerful all-electric model in that it displaces the 4 Series Gran Coupe derived i4 and the iX3 spun-off of the X3. Compared to the 50i, the M60i’s visual enhancements comprise standard 21-inch gloss black/titanium bronze M alloy wheels, blue M branded brake calipers, titanium bronze accents and a choice of seven colours as well as 22-inch alloys from the options list. While the interior is largely carried over from the standard iX with the main difference being an assortment of M specific veneers and materials, the M60i has been tweaked underneath its skin in-line with its M Performance credentials. This means the standard inclusion of the otherwise optional Active Steering system, a model specific M dual-axle adaptive air suspension with electronic shock absorbers, launch control and as indicated by the calipers, uprated M sport brakes. Performance-wise, the M60i retains its sibling’s dual-motor configuration, driven by a larger 111.5 kWh battery. Switched to Normal mode, the M60i produces 397kW/1 015Nm, which increases to 455kW/1 100Nm when in Sport mode. In the latter setting, and with the launch control engaged, the M60i will sprint from 0-100 km/h in 3.8 seconds and top out at 250 km/h. The claimed range is 566 km with 35 a minute waiting time from 10-80% when using a 200 kW charging station. Going on sale in June, the M60i, at present, has not been confirmed for South Africa, however, expect it to potentially become available at some point with likely pricing of around R3-million.
