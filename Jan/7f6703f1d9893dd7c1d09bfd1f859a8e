The league, however, refused to allow the postponements, in line with a PSL executive committee decision that Covid-19 could not be used as a decision to call off a game. Chiefs did not turn up for games against City and Arrows, and could well face a 3-0 defeat being awarded against them in both matches. Majavu, who was recently re-appointed by the PSL, added that Chiefs’ hearing would be heard on January 21. Cape Town City, meanwhile, appeared before the PSL Disciplinary Committee on Wednesday, and pleaded guilty to failing to provide their player registration cards for a game against Maritzburg United on December 7. City won the game 3-2 but it could well be a 3-0 win is awarded against them now, though Majavu said no decision has been made on the punishment as yet. “The final sanction is reserved for the Disciplinary Committee and should be announced no later than next week Tuesday,” added Majavu.
