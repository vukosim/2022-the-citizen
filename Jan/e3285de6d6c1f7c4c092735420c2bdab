One of Limpopo’s finest singers, songwriters and record producers, King Monada has entered the entrepreneurial scene with a new product in the pleasure business.  Taking to social media, the 29-year-old Malwedhe star announced he will be launching his own condom brand named King Monada, which can be bought directly from him and his team. “If they did it why can’t we did it. We can did it too. Get yourself a box now. Call 081 013 6005 to place an order,” said Monada in a Tweet. The condoms are packaged in black wrappers, and have “King Monada Ex Yaka” written on the front, with “King Monada” written repetitively all over the back.

That’s my house,” said the singer in the caption of his post. Monada’s fans and followers took to the comment section of the post to congratulate the star on his wonderful achievement, and to express how beautiful his home looks. The star also posted that he would be having a house warming party in the year 2035 once his home is completely finished, and that everyone is invited.  “I never said I’ll work on a big project like this … Two steps to go then we are done. You are all invited to my house warming on 26 November 2035. Yes 2035,” said Monada.
