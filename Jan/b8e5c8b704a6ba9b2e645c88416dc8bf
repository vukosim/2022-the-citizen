Stellenbosch FC have finally signed Sibongiseni “Ox” Mthethwa from Black Leopards. ALSO READ: Maritzburg United announce five new signingsThe Western Cape based side had initially wanted to sign the highly rated midfielder in June last after Black Leopards had been relegated. But the two sides could not agree on a deal at the time with Stellies finding what Leopards wanted for the 27-year-old too much.  Phakaaathi has however been told that a deal has been struck and Mthethwa has already left Venda for Stellenbosch.  “The deal was reached at the weekend and finalised on Monday. Leopards asked Mthethwa that he train with them for the last time on Monday so he could properly announce to his teammates that he was moving on.  “The team manager took him to Johannesburg where he was to take a flight to Durban so he can go home to Estcourt (KwaZulu-Natal) first as he is only expected to report for duty at Stellies on Monday.   “They gave him a few days off since coach Steve Barker is also away for the (DStv) Compact Cup and will only be back on Monday,” said the source.  Another source said Barker was really pleased that he has finally secured Mthethwa.“Barker was impressed by the boy from last season and has not stopped following him. He feels he will be the right fit especially with Nathan Sinkala leaving at the end of the season. The team is already thin in midfield because the gap left by (Phathutshedzo) Nange was never really filled,” said the source.
