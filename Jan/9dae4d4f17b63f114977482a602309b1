Phenisile Mongqawa has a narrow lead in the 2022 Highveld Work Riders’ Challenge going into the second leg of the three-leg showdown at the Vaal on Thursday. Defending champion Joe Gwingwizha is in fourth place on the leader board but rides a couple of well-fancied runners on the day and will be keen to close the gap. Gwingwizha’s best chances appear to be for trainer Paul Matchett –Monsieur Chevelle (Race 2) and Twice A Miracle (Race 8). Coming In Hot (Race 4) and Broadway (Race 7) for Fanie Bronkhorst could also provide him with valuable points. Mongqawa, an employee of Paul Peter who gets strong support from Joburg’s leading trainer in the work rider series, has a decent book, without any standouts. Sam Mosia, a former challenge champion, lies in second place after the first leg. The best of his seven engagements is Johan Janse van Vuuren-trained Arizona Lady in the second.
