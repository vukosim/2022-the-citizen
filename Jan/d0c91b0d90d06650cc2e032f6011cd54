Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula says the Department of Transport will appeal the Pretoria High Court’s ruling that declared the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (Aarto) acts unconstitutional and invalid. Releasing the festive season road safety statistics on Tuesday, Mbalula described Aarto as the “final piece of the puzzle” in paving the way for a new road traffic management system in the country.  “The importance of Aarto in driving behaviour change of motorists and providing disincentives for unbecoming conduct cannot be overemphasised. “It is for these reasons that we have decided to appeal the ruling of the Pretoria High Court declaring the Aarto Act unconstitutional and invalid,” he said during a media briefing.

Outa had asked the court to declare both acts unconstitutional, which was opposed by Mbalula and the Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA). In the judgement, Judge Annali Basson ruled that both acts “must be declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution in its entirety”. Basson also ordered the minister and the RTIA to pay the organisation’s costs, including the costs of two counsels. The Department of Transport early in 2021 announced Aarto’s effective date as 1 July. However, the act was not going be introduced all at once, but rather over four phases. The amended Aarto Act includes the much-maligned demerit system. Motorists will have a 12-month reprieve as the online demerit system is only scheduled to go into operation as the final phase rollout on 1 July 2022.
