Limpopo might be at the bottom of the list in terms of the matric pass rate last year, but the province’s basic education MEC Polly Boshielo is smiling after none of the province’s 3 000 schools produced 0% matric pass again.  In 2020, seven provincial schools produced no matriculants.  Most of those schools were found in remote rural villages, especially in Mopani and Sekhukhune districts. Among them was Ralerumo Secondary School in Taolome Village in Bolobedu, where angry parents showed the school principal the door for the school’s dismal performance.  “Zero percent has been a constant feature in our National Senior Certificate results in the past four to five years,” said Boshielo.

He said Limpopo was among provinces which contributed immensely with quality passes to the national tally.  “Under your tutelage Mme Boshielo, this province is going places. We are pleading to you parents, teachers and pupils to work together and ensure that we do better next year,” he said.
