Viktor Hovland made a remarkable final-round charge to defeat Richard Bland in the first playoff hole and win the Dubai Desert Classic on Sunday. The 24-year-old Norwegian, six shots off overnight leader Justin Harding, produced a storming finish, sandwiching a terrific eagle two on the par-4 17th hole with birdies on the 16th and 18th to close with a sensational six-under par 66. That took him to 12-under par and set the clubhouse mark, which was later matched by England’s Bland, double the age of Hovland, after a stunning 22-feet birdie on the 18th hole. Bland, who turns 49 in three days, chipped in for a birdie on the difficult ninth hole, and then holed his tough bunker shot on the par-3 11th. However, the most crucial shot was the 22-feet birdie putt on the 18th, as he closed with a 68.

Hovland never looked in contention after making a three-putt bogey from 33 feet on the 15th hole.  But he then drained a 35-footer for birdie on the 16th, a 33-footer for eagle on the 17th and missed a 40-footer for eagle on the 18th, and he is expected to rise two places to number 3 in the world rankings next week. After putting up a fight, South African contenders Justin Harding and Erik van Rooyen both finished in a tie for fourth place at 8-under par.
