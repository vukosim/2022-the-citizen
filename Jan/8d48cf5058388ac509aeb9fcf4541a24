The Bulls’ latest recruit, Cyle Brink, will make his debut for the side when they take on Western Province in a Currie Cup encounter on Wednesday night. The Bulls will head to Cape Town with a strong team for their second match of the 2022 campaign. After getting the season off to a winning start in the opening match against the Pumas last weekend, head coach Gert Smal selected an equally exciting match-day 23 for the traditional North versus South derby at DHL Stadium.

Veteran flyhalf Morne Steyn will spearhead a thrilling backline which will include a centre pairing of Harold Vorster and Lionel Mapoe, while the back three will be made up of Sibongile Novuka and Canan Moodie, with James Verity-Amm starting at fullback. Smal said Western Province would be dangerous as home.  “We are fortunate to have the opportunity to blend some valuable experience with some exciting youthful talent for this important fixture. “We are looking forward to a tough physical battle and some entertaining rugby which we have become accustomed to when these two sides face each other.” Bulls: James Verity-Amm, Canan Moodie, Lionel Mapoe, Harold Vorster, Sibongile Novuka, Morne Steyn, Marco Jansen van Vuren, Muller Uys, Cyle Brink, Marcell Coetzee (capt), Janko Swanepoel, Sintu Manjezi, Robert Hunt, Bismarck du Plessis, Simphiwe Matanzima.
