Upon arrival, Kati asked the homeless man who was preparing the meal to extinguish his fire but the man refused to do so. He told the officers that he was hungry and was boiling water to prepare pap for the day. According to witnesses, Kati then kicked over the man’s pot, resulting in an argument between the officers, the man and Xolirha. A scuffle then broke out, during which Xolirha was shot in the mouth. He later died. Advocate John Riley, for the accused, told the court that this was a possible case of self defence. He asked the court to consider that this was also the accused’s first offence. He said that his client is fatherless and currently the breadwinner in his household.

The case has been postponed to 12 April 2022 for further investigation.
