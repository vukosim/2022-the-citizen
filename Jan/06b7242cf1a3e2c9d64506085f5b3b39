Lebohang Msiza’s role on the telenovela The Queen gets under a lot of people’s skin as his character Clive is arrogant, controlling, manipulative and an abusive partner.  The multitalented Lebohang is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to his acting skills. Lebohang is a South African actor from Kwa-Thema. The 29-year-old has dabbled in music, modelling and dancing; and is now cementing himself in the acting industry. His passion for acting goes back to when he was in school. Though, Lebohang later dropped out to pursue his dream. The actor said his parents insisted he go to university, and that’s the only reason he enrolled for a BCom in accounting. “I felt like I was suffocating while doing accounting,” the model told News24.  He started his acting career with an appearance on Generations: The Legacy in 2015. After that, he ended up getting roles on other telenovelas such as Rhythm City, Maseko Ties, Ring of Lies, Now or Never and MTV Shuga Down South.  His fans believe the 29-year-old has mastered this particular style of acting because he had a similar role when he played Nkosana on SABC2’s Lithapo. The character was also self-centred. Fans of The Queen took to Twitter to voice their opinions on the show’s current storyline and the character. Clive seems to be making a statement as people always have a thing or two to say about his role.  “He’s definitely killing it, and I wish to see more of Clive on The Queen,” one user tweeted. Others are not so supportive of the character: “You know, I stopped watching The Queen because of Clive. He makes me angry, he can be controlling and emotionally abusive, I want his role abolished, it is too much to take for me.”
