Happy endings and fairy tales do not seem to be in Hlomu’s books as she is constantly faced with trials and tribulations in her relationship and as the new wife in the Zulu family. The latest three episodes triggered many viewers and sparked emotions of hatred and contempt towards Mqhele after he laid his hands on Hlomu once again, despite the fact that he once promised that he would never hit her again.  What’s worse is that Mahlomu was pregnant with her first child with Mqhele, but lost her child due to the beating she got from her husband.  The episodes released on Wednesday evening saw Hlomu getting medical attention from the hospital where, coincidently, her ex-fiancé Sandile works.  Viewers were annoyed with Hlomu’s decision to allow Sandile to examine her and take care of her, and felt that it would have been better for her to request a different doctor, or go to a completely different hospital to seek medical help.

Viewers were also upset by Hlomu’s decision to keep her pregnancy as well as her miscarriage to herself, and not telling Mqhele, as they felt this information could put a stop to the physical abuse which she has endured in her marriage.  Meanwhile, as viewers find it hard to maintain their adoration for Mqhele, they have expressed how Abdul Khoza continues to deliver an excellent performance as his character Nqoba, and some have said how he may actually be the best actor on the series.  His hard-headed character is still trying to navigate through his complicated relationship with Mandisa, the mother of his son, but he has recently found himself in a lustful, sexual relationship with the commissioner’s wife, who is in charge of Zandile’s case.
