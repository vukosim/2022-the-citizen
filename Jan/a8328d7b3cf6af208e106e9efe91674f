BEST BET RACE 1 NO 2 TRUMPS EXPRESS – WIN Gavin Smith’s charge is clearly not going to Hollywood but after three seconds and a fourth on the Polytrack, his trainer has reverted to running him on turf. This is an extremely weak field and is the perfect chance for this gelding t get out of the maidens. VALUE BET RACE 6 NO 4 EMALINE – EACHWAY This filly transferred from the Mike de Kock yard to Gavin Smith in Port Elizabeth and won her first start in the province on the turf. She has since moved to the Polytrack and although she had some weak places, did not show her best form. She is back on the turf in a very open race and is expected to run well in this field.
