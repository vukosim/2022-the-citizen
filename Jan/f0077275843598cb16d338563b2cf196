The SABC has clarified the circumstances and reports regarding the debacle of Metro FM host Dineo Ranaka’s recent suspension.  Publication Sunday World reported that her suspension was not about her participation in the Umlando dance challenge but rather due to her refusing to apologise to management for dancing on top of the expensive studio equipment. The SABC responded to The Citizen on Monday and denied the report.   Group executive for corporate affairs and marketing Gugu Ntuli said: “The SABC can confirm that Ms Dineo Ranaka is back as she resumed her duties today.  “It is also not true that she refused to apologise for the incident that led to her being unscheduled. Ms Ranaka has cooperated with station management throughout this time.” Sunday World cited a source, a Metro FM employee, who said Dineo’s actions caught the attention of station manager Kina Nhlengethwa. The employee alleged Nhlengethwa wanted Dineo to apologise for her “ill-discipline,” but the media personality did not want to. Dineo caused quite the stir last week for her dance moves to Toss’ hit song uMlando featuring 9umba, Mdoovar, Sino Msolo, Lady Du, Young Stunna, Sir Trill and Slade.  The #UmlandoChallenge requires you to shake your hips from side to side and up and down in the most random and creative places as the Amapiano song plays over the video. The original video on Twitter has over 1 million views, while Dineo’s has over 730,000 views.  Another radio host Thando “Thabooty” Thabethe showed off her moves to uMlando at the 947 studios shortly after news of Dineo’s suspension. While some thought she was making fun of Dineo’s situation, others viewed Thando’s actions as a show of solidarity with Dineo. The fact that the official 947 Twitter account even shared the video shows that she had the support of her employers at Primedia.  Dineo is the host of The Bridge, which airs between 9am and 12pm, and listeners were happy with her return on Monday.
