South African choreographer, media personality and television host Somizi Mhlongo has opened the door to a new business venture in the clothing industry.  The 49-year-old celebrity cook has taken to social media to announce that he will soon be launching his own children’s clothing line named Sompire Kids which he has been working on for the past year.  “Its been over a year working on this and I have faith that mamas and papas are gonna love this. Sompire Kids launching very soon.  “Clothing range for the happiest kids of Africa, for the smartest, confident, proud, joyful, prettiest, most handsome, tall, short, light, dark, all body types amazing children,” said Mhlongo in the caption of his post.  In the teaser video he posted on his Instagram page, we can see the logo of Somizi’s clothing brand and some adorable designs of the clothing items which will be available under his brand and in his store to little girls and boys across the country.   After making an exit last year from Idols SA as a judge, and another exit from Metro FM as a radio presenter due to abuse allegations made against him by his estranged husband Mohale Motaung, the media personality will apparently be making a comeback on the new season of Idols SA as one of the judges, according to City Press.  That, however, is not the only change viewers will get to see on Idols SA as it has been reported that television personality and singer Unathi Nkayi will be taking a break from the judging panel of the singing competition.  It is believed that the decision to have Nkayi step down from the singing competition is a result of a heated argument between her and fellow Kaya FM colleague Sizwe Dhlomo, which got her fired with immediate effect from Kaya FM sometime in November 2021.
