He was recently with Black Leopards as an assistant since last year in October. In a statement released by the club, Mhlongo is set to be in charge of the club for the rest of the season and he will be assisted by Tendani Tanyanyiwa and Percyvell Nkabinde. “TS Sporting is proud to announce with immediate effect the return of Benson Mhlongo as head coach. The 41-year old former Black Leopards assistant coach has established his coaching in the ABC, NFD and the PSL and he is no stranger to TS Sporting,” read the statement. “His knowledge and experience will add value to TS Sporting technical team. Mr Mhlongo will be assisted by Tendani Tanyanyiwa and Percyvell Nkabinde. We would like to take this opportunity to wish him well in his duties till the end of the 2021/2022 season.” Having retired in 2016 at Pirates after a sterling career turning out for Mamelodi Sundowns, Platinum Stars, Polokwane City, SuperSport Unite, Alex United and Wits University, his managerial career would start with the Buccaneers just after hanging his boots as an assistant to Augusto Palacios following the resignation of Muhsin Ertugral. At Pirates, Mhlongo also worked with Kjell Jonevret and Micho Sredojevic. He takes over Sporting with the club struggling in the league. They are in 14th place on the log after only managing to collect 15 points after 17 games. Mhlongo replaces Milton Dlamini at Sporting, and the club has already changed coaches two times in the last year, with Kabelo Sibiya leaving his post prior to the start of the current season.
