We applaud the ladies for defeating Sekondi Hasaacas Ladies F.C. in the finals hosted in Egypt,” said the Sports Minister. “Women are showing us how to win in sports. A special thank you to Sasol for believing in women’s football when a few believed in that vision to establish women’s football” Another important factor that the minister touched on was Caf’s new condition, that will force every team that competes in continental football to start having female teams. In that way, club’s like Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs, will have to make it a point that they begin to launch women’s sides if they wish to take any part in the Caf Champions League or the Caf Confederation Cup. “We applaud Caf for their club licensing condition indicating that all recognised men’s clubs as of 2022 will be required to have a female team in its set to participate in the CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup.”
