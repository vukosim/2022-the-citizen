The Department of Agriculture’s State Veterinary Service has served a quarantine notice on pig farmers in Thembalethu, George.  This follows the laboratory confirmation that African Swine Fever (ASF) has been detected in the area. It was also detected in KwaNonqaba outside Mossel Bay earlier this month. ASF is a highly contagious haemorrhagic viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, which is responsible for serious economic and production losses.  There is currently no approved vaccine for the disease. According to the US Department of Agriculture, ASF is not a threat to human health, and cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans.

Minister Ivan Meyer urged pig farmers to practice good biosecurity measures to ensure animal health and safety. “Farmers must practise good hygiene management practices on their farms to minimise the risk of disease introduction or spread of the disease through good biosecurity measures,” Meyer said. Dr Gininda Msiza, Head of Veterinary Services, said pigs should be confined to prevent roaming and the spread of the disease.  Carcasses should also be disposed of safely.

Meat produce should also be thoroughly cooked before being fed to pigs. Meyer said the department will continue to monitor the situation.  He also gave reassurance that veterinary services will provide any necessary advisory services to combat the spread of the disease. Compiled by Karabo Mashaba.
