Kaya FM host and South African businessman Sizwe Dhlomo broke a lot of hearts on Friday when he posted a rare picture of his longtime girlfriend Kim De Morney.  In an uncharacteristic move by Sizwe, who is not one to share too much about his personal life, he shared a snap of himself and Kim in the pool taken during his ongoing friendcation with Anele Mdoda, Trevor Noah, Trevor’s girlfriend Minka Kelly, advertising exec Xolisa Dyeshana and chief marketing officer at rain South Africa, Khaya Dlanga. “I’m so hurt. funny thing I’m not even into his type,” joked @mathibelanelly in the comments under Sizwe’s post.  “Just a reminder that he doesn’t know you,” joked another fan who had tagged a friend who presumably has a crush on the Kaya FM DJ.  “Ewu kwa phela amaphupho for the other ‘crushees’,” added Trillestkg, stating that the dreams of other people who may have had a crush on Sizwe have now been crushed by this post.  Sizwe has been in a relationship with Kim De Morney for a few years and she even joined the squad on their friendcation to China a few years ago.  She is not in the entertainment industry and works as an industrial relations specialist. When she is not at work, she enjoys travelling, whether alone or with Sizwe. Kim is also a fitness fanatic who often competes in endurance challenges.  Perhaps Sizwe was inspired to make this move by his friend Trevor, who brought his girlfriend, actress Minka Kelly, with him to South Africa during his most recent trip home.  She has even happily featured in images posted by Trevor’s friends Khaya and Anele.  In fact, Anele’s content is all about Trevor recently, including a hilarious dance-off that the two had during an afternoon spent on a boat.
