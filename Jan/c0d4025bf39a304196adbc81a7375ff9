The largest sources of tax revenue were still personal income tax at 39,1%, corporate income tax at 16.4% and value-added tax (VAT) at 26.5%, making up 81.9% of total tax revenue collections. The tax-to-GDP ratio moderated from 23.8% in 2019/20 to 22.5% in 2020/21, primarily due to annual reductions in the revenue collected from personal income tax, value-added tax, and domestic specific excise duties.

Job losses and decreases in wages had a negative impact on personal income tax, while the pandemic, job losses, low consumption demand, strained company profitability following the hard lockdown coupled with heightened uncertainty in global demand remain key risks to economic growth and revenue.
