South African actress, writer and entrepreneur Sonia Mbele is a trending topic once again after breaking the internet with a saucy picture that does not leave much to the imagination of her fans and followers.  The 45-year-old producer took to her social media pages to post two pictures of herself in a baby pink crochet bikini which she styled with a pink and blue tie dye collard shirt, square-shaped sunglasses, and light brown bob wig.  The pictures were taken at the Oâ€™Two Boutique Hotel in Mouille Point, Cape Town where Sonia has been staying throughout her vacation in the city which began about a week ago.  The mother of two also took to social media to post more content from her vacation which included more pictures from the hotel, as well as pictures of herself on a boat ride.  Mbele also posted a reel that showed some footage from her flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town, as well as her stunning hotel room at the boutique hotel.  Making headlines is not a new thing for the former Generations star as she was a trending topic on social media sometime in November last year after posting pictures on Instagram and Twitter of herself wearing a revealing maroon shoulder string tank top with powder blue mom jeans.  Later that month, Sonia announced the launch of her bottled water brand called Alkamax, and taking to social media, she shared pictures of her launch party which was attended by her closest friends and family members to celebrate her new business.
