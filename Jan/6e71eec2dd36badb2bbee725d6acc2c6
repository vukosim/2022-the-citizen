India won the toss and opted to bat in the second Test against South Africa at the Wanderers on Monday morning. In a surprise in the India team selection, opener KL Rahul will captain the side in the absence of the injured Virat Kohli. Kohli has an “upper back spasm,” according to Rahul and will “hopefully recover by the next Test.” Coming in for Kohli is Hanuma Vihari. South Africa, who will bowl first, have made two changes to their side from the first Test defeat in Centurion, having included Kyle Verreynne as wicket-keeper in place of the retired Quinton de Kock, while fast bowler Duanne Olivier comes in for all-rounder Wiaan Mulder.
