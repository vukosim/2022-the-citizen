Go-getter, trend setter, and media personality Bonang Matheba is planning on leaving the country once again, but where could she be planning to go this time around?  The television presenter made her way back home in December just in time for the festive season, after getting off to New York City without any warning, where she lived and worked for a couple of months.  Taking to social media, the former Top Billing presenter shared a tweet where she was complaining about Johannesburg’s water services. A follower close to Bonang welcomed her back into town after she had spent some time vacationing in Cape Town, and she quoted the tweet by hinting that she will be leaving soon.  ALSO READ: Bonang Matheba won’t give up on taking legal action against Rea Gopane Sometime in May 2021, a podcaster name Rea Gopane made allegations on his YouTube channel against Bonang, alleging that “everyone” in the entertainment industry knows that Bonang “introduced AKA to cocaine”.  Not taking the matters lightly, Bonang sent a letter of demand to Rea in pursuit of an apology and retraction, and then later requested that the Youtuber pay her a sum of R500 000 in damages.  The media personality took to social media earlier today to share that she “won”.  Her followers have speculated that she may be talking about the case she opened against Gopane, and that the YouTuber has been requested to pay Matheba R300 000 for the damages he has made to her reputation.  Rea is not the only legal battle Matheba was faced with in the previous year.  She took to Twitter in October 2021 to announce that she was parting ways with renowned management agency Celebrity Services Africa (CSA). The former radio presenter alleged that her business relationship with CSA had soured, and claimed the agency was acting on her behalf without her knowledge. CSA however claimed they played an important part in creating BNG, and that the copyright and trademark of the alcoholic beverage is legally owned by them.
