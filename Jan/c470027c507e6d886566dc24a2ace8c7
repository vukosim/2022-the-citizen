Similar to The Simpsons, the animated series has predicted events around the world before they occurred. It predicted that Elon Musk would want to build a rocket to send to Mars, as well as the spread of the Ebola virus and that Donald Trump would be president.  It has been named one of the all-time greatest TV shows by Entertainment Weekly, the Emmy in 2008 for Outstanding Animated Program and Peabody Award-winning in 2005.  The South Park voice actors are unknown to most people other than die-hard fans. They are most notably Parker and Stone, who do most of the male characters on the show, along with April Stewart and Mona Marshall, who do the female characters. The 25th season premieres on Comedy Central, Sunday, 6 February at 10pm and will be available on DStv Catch Up.
