Former Springbok loose forward Willem Alberts is set to start in the second row for the Lions in their Round 9 United Rugby Championship encounter with the Bulls on Saturday. The versatile forward, who has played most of his rugby over the years in the back row, replaces Pieter Jansen van Vuren, who suffered a pectoral muscle injury during training this week. This means that former Junior Springbok Ruan Venter, fresh from Currie Cup duty, could get an opportunity off the bench in the eagerly anticipated Jukskei derby. “I feel for Pieter. He worked so hard to come back from his knee injury he suffered on tour (last year). We wish him a speedy recovery from this latest setback,” said Lions boss Ivan van Rooyen. “The opportunity now awaits Ruan, who’s had a fantastic past few months, including a SA Rugby U20 Cup winner’s medal. He could possibly get his chance on Saturday. “Providing opportunities to young players is a common theme for us here at the franchise and it’s something we pride ourselves in.” Elsewhere, Emmanuel Tshituka, younger brother of Vincent, wears the No 7 jersey, with PJ Botha coming in at hooker for the injured Jaco Visagie. Morne Brandon, Ruhan Straeuli and Sibusiso Sangweni complete the new additions to the replacements. The Lions are coming off a narrow defeat against the Sharks, while the Bulls also lost last week, to the Stormers at Loftus. Kick off on Saturday is 3pm.
