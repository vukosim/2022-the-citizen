The suspect had been working at a Knysna bank at the time, and offered to safeguard the Krugerrands. After the complainant requested to have her Krugerrands returned, the suspect refused. She then laid a criminal complaint of theft against him. Eden Cluster Commander Brigadier Phumzile Cetyana commended the investigating team and the K9’s for their persistence to bring this suspect to book.  “This shows our commitment and demonstrates the lengthy arm of the law that will stop at nothing to bring culprits as such to account for their deeds”, he said.
