There are two injury-enforced changes to the Stormers forward pack for the United Rugby Championship encounter with the Sharks in Durban on Saturday. There are three changes in total to the starting line-up that did duty last week in Pretoria for the coastal clash, which kicks off at 5.05pm on Saturday. Lock Salmaan Moerat (knee) and No 8 Evan Roos (minor rib injury) have both been ruled out, with Adre Smith and Hacjivah Dayimani coming in to replace them in the starting line-up. The only change to the backline sees Angelo Davids start on the right wing. Loose forwards Nama Xaba and Marcel Theunissen both come onto the replacements bench, having impressed for Western Province in the Currie Cup.

Stormers: Damian Willemse, Angelo Davids, Ruhan Nel, Rikus Pretorius, Seabelo Senatla, Manie Libbok, Herschel Jantjies, Hacjivah Dayimani, Ernst van Rhyn, Deon Fourie, Marvin Orie, Adre Smith, Sazi Sandi, Scarra Ntubeni, Steven Kitshoff (capt). Bench: Andre-Hugo Venter, Leon Lyons, Brok Harris, Nama Xaba, Marcel Theunissen, Paul de Wet, Dan du Plessis, Warrick Gelant.
