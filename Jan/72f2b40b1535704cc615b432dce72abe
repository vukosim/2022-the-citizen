Easily one of the most highly anticipated new M models of recent years, BMW has officially confirmed the unveiling later this year of the first ever M3 Touring. Sporadically teased last year, after being confirmed in October 2020, the latest teaser, posted by the BMW M Instagram page, shows the thinly disguised M3 Touring sliding on a snowy mountain top whilst being guided by a helicopter. The powersliding and various instructions from the chopper eventually culminates in “2022” being spelled out across the frigid backdrop, confirming the launch year previously thought to be 2023.

This means the same 375kW/650Nm from the 3.0-litre turbocharged S58 straight-six as in the Competition sedan and M4 Competition, fed to all four corners via an eight-speed Steptronic gearbox. Aside from the estate bodystyle, the Touring sports the same controversial front-end facia as its sedan and coupe siblings, with the unseen interior likely to feature the same array of M specific tweaks and additions. Aside from the RS4, the M3 Touring will also take aim at the incoming four-cylinder, electrified Mercedes-AMG C63 S, which is also expected to make the transition from rear-wheel-drive to all-wheel-drive when it bows this year. While an official launch date is yet to be made, expect the M3 Touring to potentially debut in the first quarter of the year, before going on sale soon after. For now, it remains to be seen whether BMW South Africa will be compelled to bring the Touring to South Africa in order to rival the RS4.
