South Africa’s women’s Proteas cricket team have been dealt a huge blow following the news that regular captain and star all-rounder Dané van Niekerk will miss the World Cup in New Zealand in March. Van Niekerk broke her left ankle  last week, also ruling her out of the series against the West Indies which starts at the end of the month in Joburg. Van Niekerk also won’t take part in a training camp ahead of the ODI series between 28 January and 6 February. CSA on Thursday named 21 players to prepare for that series and the World Cup, to be held in New Zealand. Proteas team doctor, Tshegofatso Gaetsewe said of Van Niekerk’s injury: “The injury is a result of an accidental slip on a wet surface at home. “As things stand, she doesn’t require surgery but will be monitored closely. It’s a stable fracture with minimal displacement and her recovery timeline is no less than 12 weeks,” she added. Despite the absence of the captain, the team ranked second in the ODI format have selected a formidable squad featuring stalwarts Shabnim Ismail, Marizanne Kapp, Ayabonga Khaka and ICC Women’s Cricketer of the Year nominee, Lizelle Lee. The list also includes uncapped Western Province batter, Delmari Tucker, while Raisibe Ntozakhe receives another opportunity to impress in pursuit of a first cap since 2018, with the likes of all-rounders, Chloe Tryon and Sune Luus, as well as seamer Masabata Klaas and wicket-keeper Trisha Chetty also in the mix.
