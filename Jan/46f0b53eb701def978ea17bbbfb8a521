The HDMI standard is evolving, with a new update that promises to be spectacular.  This new 2.1a standard should make it possible to optimize all the content of a HDR (high dynamic range) display, whatever the lighting conditions. It promises to be a big hit at CES 2022, which will (still) be held in Las Vegas from January 5 to 8, 2022. The HDMI Forum has announced an evolution of its digital audio/video standard. The version 2.1a integrates a major addition, Source-Based Tone Mapping (SBTM).  This enables optimization of the HDR display in dynamic mode, meaning that it automatically adapts to any video sequence, without the slightest adjustment to be made beforehand.  This will obviously only be possible on devices that are compatible (or updated) with this new standard. Some of them could be unveiled in a few days at CES. HDR allows for a dynamic range of vibrant colours and improved brightness. In dynamic mode, this technology is applied continuously, regardless of the type of lighting in a new movie scene or game sequence.  HDMI 2.1a promises to optimize this ability to bring out the colours and take full advantage of a specific display systemâ€™s HDR capability. The first HDMI 2.1 compatible devices appeared in 2019. It offers support for HDR Dynamic, Dolby Atmos and a bandwidth that can theoretically reach 48 Gbps.
