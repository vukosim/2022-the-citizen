Gabadinho Mhango has earned himself a few admirers following his excellent showing with Malawi at the Africa Cup of Nations. A source close to Mhango’s handlers at ProSport International said the player has already had a few clubs from Europe ask about him.

He could possibly be headed for a move outside the country in the near future as I understand Orlando Pirates will be willing to let him go should a good offer come along,” said a source.  Pirates are believed to have also moved quickly to exercise their option on his contract to keep him for at least an extra year. Before his Afcon exploits where he scored some incredible goals, notably the long range strike against Morocco in the knockout stages, Mhango was facing a bleak future at Pirates.  “The club was even thinking of using him for a swap deal with Royal AM for Victor Letsoalo. But I think they may have changed their minds now that he has reminded them what he is capable of when he is in the right frame of mind,” said another source.
