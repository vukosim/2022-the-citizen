Having set the ball in motion with the unveiling of the Tiggo 4 Pro last year, resurgent Chinese auto giant Chery has provided select details of its second new model, the Tiggo 8 Pro. Teased along with the Tiggo 4 Pro and the step-up below Tiggo 7 Pro at the official South African market relaunch in August, the Tiggo 8 Pro currently serves as Chery’s flagship crossover/SUV in China, with its impending debut coming on the back of a mid-life facelift in 2021. Based on Chery’s T1X platform, the Tiggo 8 Pro measures 4 722 mm in overall length with its wheelbase spanning 2 710 mm. Standing 1 860 mm tall, the 1 745 mm wide newcomer offers a choice of five or seven-seats, but for South Africa, will be equipped as standard with latter arrangement. Although exact specification is yet to be confirmed, disclosed items, likely on the top-spec derivative only, comprises dual-zone climate control, a surround-view camera system, a dual TFT instrument cluster and infotainment display, as well as an eight-speaker Sony sound system.

Like the Tiggo 4 Pro, drive will go to the front wheels via an automatic gearbox, mostly likely a seven-speed dual-clutch. “While the Tiggo 4 Pro and our one-million-kilometre mechanical warranty has done a lot to demonstrate the quality and technology available in Chery vehicles, the Tiggo 8 Pro will simply blow people away,” Chery South Africa Executive Deputy General Manager Tony Liu said. An exact launch date, together with pricing details, remains to be confirmed, but expect details to be divulged over the coming weeks.
