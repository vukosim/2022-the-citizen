FAIRVIEW TURF BEST BET RACE 5 NO 3 NATIVE TONGUE – WIN Trainer Justin Snaith and jockey Richard Fourie will be having a full-scale raid on Port Elizabeth today and this four-year-old gelding looks one their best. His last two races were in Grade 2 company and last time, in the Premier Trophy, finished 1.55 lengths behind Hoedspruit who is running in the Cape Town Met tomorrow. He looks in a different to his opposition and it is a surprise to see him priced up at relatively good odds of 2-1. VALUE BET RACE 2 NO 7 SWEET THE SKY – EACHWAY Jockey arrangements make this Alan Greeff-trained runner an interesting proposition. Greg Cheyne has been riding the more fancied Europeana in his last couple of starts but has got off that mount to go with Sweet The Sky at 14-1 This filly had some good form on the turf but failed in her next couple of runs on the Polytrack. She returns to the turf today and that could make quite a difference. Could be nice value at 14-1.
