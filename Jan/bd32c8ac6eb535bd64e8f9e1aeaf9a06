BEST BET RACE 2 SWINGER: 4-SENTBYDESTINY AND 6-TEAM GOLD With two scratchings in this race, the field is down to five runners and that means there is only one swinger – first and second in any order. Sentbydestiny, a Grade 1 winner against the colts as a two-year-old, looks to be regaining her best form and is the runner to bet while Team Gold does emerge as her main danger. VALUE BET RACE 7: QUARTET: DOUBLE FLOAT 2-SUPREME QUEST AND 3-BOLD ACT WITH THE FIELD Supreme Quest is the in-form horse while Bold Act, although coming back from a break, has performed well in feature races for the Mike de Kock stable.  After that this race is quite open so one must include the balance of the field. As along as the two floaters run in the first four, you will collect. The full cost of this best is R240 but 10% is just R24.
