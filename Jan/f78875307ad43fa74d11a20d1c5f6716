Kaizer Chiefs reserves coach Vela Khumalo is happy to see his team learn from their mistakes and he believes the team will get better as the season goes by.

I am glad to say that the boys have adhered to whatever we have done throughout the week. We are good in attack and we always try to organise at the back. We are getting there. With time, we will get better and minimise the mistakes,” Khumalo told the Chiefs media. “The team is improving now. We came from a situation wherein the latter part of last year we had players missing as a result of school exams. Now we are better off in that regard. Everybody is back and we will try and do our best to help these young lads go forward in their future.” Chiefs went through some trying times last year, especially towards the end of the year with results not forthcoming as Khumalo was missing a number of his regulars. The situation saw the team drop a number of points and subsequently went down the league standings. They are sitting in 10th place on the log with 16 points after playing 13 games so far, 17 points behind Soweto rivals Orlando Pirates, who are sitting at the top of the standings with 33 points. But, Khumalo adds that they are currently assembling a strong squad and says there is a lot of talent in the team. “We have Under -19 players blended with our reserve players. Right now we are in a new cycle and building a team. These boys have talent and we are continuing to nurture them,” explained the coach.
