After her surprising suspension from Metro FM for something some consider a small incident, Dineo Ranaka has updated us on what she is working on.  It was reported that Dineo was suspended for participating in the viral Umlando Dance Challenge at the Metro FM offices. She was seen on video dancing on top of the office furniture which didn’t sit well with her bosses.  They consider her actions misconduct, but 24 hours later the radio host and DJ is still booked and busy. Seemingly unbothered by the news after being the talk of the town, Dineo posted a few posts on Instagram on Wednesday of her current activities outside the radio station.

She captioned her post: “The same boiling water that hardens the egg, softens the potato. Focus.” The soundtrack she used was You Get What You Focus On (Blessed remix) by Fearless Motivation and Tom Bilyeu, which is inspirational and motivational audio. Commentators assumed Dineo was responding to the suspension in her own way. Her fans said many radio stations are letting go of legends in the industry and hope she returns to Metro.  Others said Dineo should take this opportunity and learn from it.  Dineo also shared videos appreciating the men in her life and a meeting with Lil-lets in South Africa.  The star of The Ranaka’s shared many more motivational videos on her Instagram stories and a quote.  The Citizen has tried to reach out to Dineo’s team but our calls went straight to voicemail.
