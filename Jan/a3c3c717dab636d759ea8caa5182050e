The City of Cape Town’s mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith, said emergency services were notified of the fire shortly after 6am. Ramaphosa said the dedication of emergency services showed that “we do have one city that works, a province that works, and we do have a government that works when the chips are down. And this is a demonstration of precisely that.”  Smith explained the fire appears to have started at the office complex, and gradually spread to the gymnasium. The assembly chambers have now been affected, with significant damage to the roof, which has since collapsed. A report on the cause of the fire is expected within the next 48 hours.
