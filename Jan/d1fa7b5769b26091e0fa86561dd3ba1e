Thank you that you are on my side and for your never-ending effortlessness,” the singer said. “And thank you for the most beautiful little curly head as a symbol of our covenant.” The couple got married in January 2014 and have a daughter named Romy-Lee, who was born in 2017. Janine also took to Instagram with photos from their glamorous wedding day this morning, saying: “My love! Today we celebrate eight years of being one (with a curly head as extra), where we understand each other better than the previous year, laugh more and groan less.”  In her caption, she also says that Hofmeyr increasingly seems to realise that women are always right. She then concludes, saying: “I love you. A lot!”  Janine also quoted her anniversary card to Hofmeyr, saying that it sums things up perfectly: “Life never really turns out exactly the way you expect it to, but if you’re lucky like us, it turns out even better than you ever imagined.”
