Springbok captain Siya Kolisi reacted with modesty on Thursday after being rewarded for a brilliant season when he was crowned 2021 SA Rugby Player-of-the-Year. Kolisi enjoyed a barnstorming return to international rugby, having not played with his team since the 2019 World Cup, leading them to a series win against the British and Irish Lions and an impressive victory over the All Blacks in Australia.

Ladies and gentlemen, your SA Rugby Player of the Year for 2021 is none other than our Springbok captain, @SiyaKolisi, who led by example and is the only player to feature in all 13 Tests last year.

We are all close friends and celebrate each other’s successes,” Kolisi said.
