Police in Levubu, Limpopo, arrested a 15-year-old boy for allegedly stabbing a 34-year-old woman to death at Tshakhuma Diambele village on Monday. The victim allegedly arrived home from work at about 2:50pm and reportedly called her mother to ask about the house keys. She was reportedly directed where the keys were. The 34-year-old, identified as Phathutshedzo Nemalumani, was then found lying in a pool of blood in the house by her son, also aged 15, who had come home from school. The suspect, who is thought to be a friend of the son and who was still in the house, then started chasing the son out of the property.
