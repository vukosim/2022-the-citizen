BEST BET Race 4 No 4 Heartsease – Win This filly is overdue a win and was unlucky last time when she had to overcome No 12 but ran on best of all to finish fourth behind Rise. This time she is well drawn and will be tough to beat. VALUE BET Race 5: Quartet: Float 3 Name Of The Game and 6 Que Cosas with the field. We made a small profit at the Vaal yesterday with a Quartet and can hopefully do the same in this race. There were two key late scratching and that has left just six runners, with all having  winning chances. The full bet costs R144 but one can take 10% for just R14.40.
