Media personality and choreographer Somizi Mhlongo seems to have bounced back from the difficult year he had in 2021.  The former Idols SA judge was axed from Season 17 of the show to sort out his personal life, after his estranged husband Mohale Motaung levelled abuse allegations against him in August last year. The TV personality also took time off from Metro FM after the shocking revelation of the physical abuse allegations against him by Mohale made headlines. The estranged couple have been moving on with their respective lives, sharing their fabulous holidays and achievements on their social media accounts.

While we know that Mohale will not be a part of the new season, details surrounding the launch date of the reality show have not been confirmed. Somizi will also reportedly be returning as a guest judge for Season 18 of Idols SA.  City Press reported that “Somizi has been given the green light because he is the life of the show”.  A source close to the production told the publication that there was a huge difference when he was not on the show, in terms of declining viewership. His replacement and number one rival, UnathiNkayi will reportedly now be taking a break from the reality TV singing show. Nkayi was fired with immediate effect from Kaya FM in November last year, after an argument between her and fellow Kaya FM colleague Sizwe Dhlomo. Idols SA spokesperson Lucky Mangena did not want to confirm Somizi’s return to City Press, but he did, however, confirm that auditions for the show would start on 23 January. Somizi took to Instagram last week complaining that he is lonely and has nobody to do fun things with during his free time, because all of his friends work 9 – 5 jobs.
