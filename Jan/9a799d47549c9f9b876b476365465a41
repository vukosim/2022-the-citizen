A sergeant attached to the Phalaborwa police station in Limpopo has been suspended, after allegedly supplying liquor and marijuana to inmates on New Year’s Eve.  According to a statement by police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mokapelo, received by Polokwane Review, the incident took place at the police station’s holding cells.  Mojapelo said the 39-year-old sergeant distributed the contraband, which resulted in inmates reportedly becoming intoxicated. Chaos then ensued.  “They started assaulting and raping other inmates in the cells.  “Six counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and two counts of rape were opened,” Mojapelo told the publication.
