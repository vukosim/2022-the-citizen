Kabwe has played in the South African top tier before, having had spells with Ajax Cape Town (now known as Cape Town Spurs) and Black Leopards. He joins the club after a short spell with his home based team Zanaco FC, which he left after only joining them last year in November. Following his signing, Kabwe did not promise much, but has pledged to do everything to help the team improve from their performances from the first round of the DStv Premiership. “Of course I am not promising heaven and earth, but I am here to strengthen the team as we all know this season the team has been doing fine. But given this opportunity, I just have to do my job, which is to create and if the opportunity comes, to score and defend when I am supposed to defend,” said Kabwe. “By coming into the team is to help the team do even more because they have done fine in the first round. People expect the team to do more in the second round and that is where I come in. just to help the team to be stronger going forward.” Talking about the standard of football in the country, Kabwe believes there is no big or small teams in South Africa anymore, saying a team that gives more effort during games end up being the deserved winners of any match. “I think that is just peoples thinking, I would say football being football, when you into the field it is 11 v 11.so, of course the team that gives more is the one that is going to win, it doesn’t matter if they are big or small.”
