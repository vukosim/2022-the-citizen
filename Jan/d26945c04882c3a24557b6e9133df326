Officially one of its oldest models on sale today, Jeep has given the now eight-year old Renegade a series of updates in Brazil ahead of its still to be confirmed market debut. The second update after the initial global model tweak four years ago, the updates to what has remained one of the brand’s most important models in South America comprise a slimmer seven-slot grille, new LED daytime running lights integrated into the headlights, redesigned front and rear bumpers, new fog lamps and a new X-motif for the LED taillights. Inside, the interior sports the same steering wheel as the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, while the centre console has been upgraded to accommodate either a seven-inch or 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen infotainment system. While final specification has yet to be announced, reports from Brazil indicate the availability of tech such as Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning and an overhauled digital instrument cluster.

Badged as the T270, the Brazilian made and developed unit produces 132 kW when running on petrol or 137 kW when fuelled by ethanol with torque, as evident by the moniker, rated at 270 Nm for both. Transmissions comprise a six-speed automatic on front-wheel-drive models and a nine-speed automatic on four-wheel-drive derivatives. Expected to retails from R $100 000 (R276 496) when it goes on sale, the updated Renegade, for now, remains a Brazilian and South American market exclusive with no plans afoot for Europe, North America and of course, South Africa. Given its 2018 global update though, expect to the changes to eventually become available on international models, though with different engines and trim level designations.
