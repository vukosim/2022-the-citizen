South African golfer Erik van Rooyen will go into the rest of the 2021/2022 PGA Tour season sporting a new look – a big, bushy moustache. Van Rooyen, who won on the PGA Tour in the USA for the first time in 2021 at the Barracuda Championship last August, has shaved off his beard and is now sporting only a moustache.  He showed off his new look while preparing for this week’s 2022 PGA Tour start in Hawaii at the Sentry Tournament of Champions. In a video clip posted by the PGA Tour, Van Rooyen calls his moustache ‘ this thing at the top of my lip’ and describes it as having ‘a life of its own.’ He then goes on to explain how it came about that he is now a ‘tache man’.
