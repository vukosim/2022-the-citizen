Having divulged certain specification items of the all-new Caddy last September, Volkswagen has now officially released pricing of its first all-new small van and people mover for over 14 years. Into its fifth generation, the ID.3 and T7 inspired Caddy moves to Wolfsburg’s MQB platform and for South Africa, will be available in six variants; the conventional Caddy bus and long wheelbase Caddy Maxi, the Caddy Cargo panel van, extended wheelbase Cargo Maxi panel van, and the Kombi variants of both that offer five seats with a cargo area. Left out of the line-up, and therefore a no-no for now, is the range-topping PanAmericana that replaces the Alltrack. The California Camper has, for now, also been left-out. As already indicated, the South African-spec Caddy will stick with the outgoing model’s choice of engines, meaning the neither the European market 1.5 TSI Evo nor the 1.4 TSI are available. Also gone is the previously offered 1.0 TSI.

A six-speed manual gearbox delivers the amount of twist to the front wheels with its availability being limited to the Caddy, the Caddy Cargo and Caddy Kombi. The bulk of the range is motivated by the 2.0 TDI that develops 81kW/300Nm. It too is connected to a six-speed manual ‘box with drive going to the front wheels. For now, no plans are afoot to bring a DSG model to market, while the 4Motion derivatives offered in other markets are unlikely to be offered at any stage. Going on sale from next month, the Caddy and Caddy Maxi are covered by a three-year/120 000 km warranty, while both Cargo and Kombi versions feature a two-year/unlimited km warranty.
