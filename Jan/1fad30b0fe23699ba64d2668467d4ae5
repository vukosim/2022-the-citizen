A stunning effort with the bat from Jacob Bethell proved to be the difference on Wednesday, as England secured a Super League semi-final spot and ended South Africa’s title hopes at the U-19 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies. Bethell was a thorn in South Africa’s side, playing a part with the ball before making a classy 88 runs to help his team progress to the last four. Despite winning the toss and electing to bat in the quarterfinal clash, South Africa found scoring tough early, losing Valentine Kitime in the fourth over by the continually-impressive Josh Boyden.

Brevis continued after Maree fell to Bethell, making his fourth score over 50 for the tournament, only to fall on 97. Rehan Ahmed’s 4/48 stifled South Africa, who looked dead in the water at 169/9, but Matthew Boast and Asakhe Tsaka frustrated England with a final-wicket stand of 40, ticking over to a more respectable 209.

He would eventually be dismissed on 88 from 42 balls, though the damage was done for George Van Heerden’s side, who will now fight for the minor places. William Luxton finished the job with 47 from 41 balls at No 5, ending the match with a six as England reached 212/4 to win by six wickets. England were the first team to book their spot in the semi-finals, which are set to be played next week.
