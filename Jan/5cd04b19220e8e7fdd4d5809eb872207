Kommetdieding, the “Peoples Champion”, won the WSB Cape Town Met in thrilling style at Kenilworth on Saturday. Wild celebrations and tears of joy greeted the popular four-year-old colt as he entered the winner’s circle and was embraced by his owner, humble Cape Flats builder Ashwin Reynolds and friends and family. Driven home brilliantly by jockey Gavin Lerena, the 2-1 favourite completed the rare Durban July-Met double and confirmed himself as unarguably the best racehorse in South Africa at present.
