Powerhouse combo Paul Peter and Warren Kennedy are always a factor at Highveld race meetings, but they hold a particularly strong hand at the Vaal Classic track on Tuesday. Dronfield in Race 2 is the team’s standout runner, while Motor City Hitman in the fourth and Frontline Fighter in the eighth are also likely to be contesting finishes. The trainer-jockey duo’s most interesting runner, though, is Sound Of Summer in the day’s topliner, Race 6, a MR104 Handicap over 1600m. The four-year-old by Silvano made his debut less than a year ago but has already posted five wins in 10 starts and has never been out of the placings. A win in a race like Tuesday’s will see his rating rise that little bit that will give him a stab at the elite level in the coming months. Ranged against Sound Of Summer are a handful of horses already blooded in the big time, such as Tierra Del Fuego, Al Muthana and Chijmes. The likes of Donald McDonald and Indlamu are not far off that stratum. So, Sound Of Summer will have to confirm his obvious potential to come out tops. He does appear to sound and fit, the 1600m seems to be his ideal trip and the Peter-Kennedy machine is purring along, so a next step up the ladder is worth betting on.
