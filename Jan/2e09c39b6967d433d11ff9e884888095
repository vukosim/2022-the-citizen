VAAL CLASSIC TRACK BEST BET RACE 1 NO 10 LADY OSIER – WIN This filly has only raced once for a 2.25-length second behind Insatiable, who looks to have a bright future. Trainer Paul Peter has some good runners at the meeting but says he rates this daughter of Willow Magic highly and makes her the best of his runners on the day. VALUE BET RACE 5 NO 11 MCKENNA SKYE – EACHWAY This is another filly highly rated by trainer Paul Peter. She is a half-sister to top performer MK’s Pride and ha won two of her six starts. Her trainer believes she has an excellent winning chance today and with Warren Kennedy up and drawn No 2, her odds of 5-1 look very decent.
