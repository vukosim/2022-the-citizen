The Downs coach reveals that he only got to know Moagi when reporting for the Warriors camp and he had doubts about him at first. “With the program at Sundowns of late, one hasn’t got enough time to look at these youngsters. But when we came with this team (Dinaledi), there was a player from Sundowns (Moagi) who was in the squad,” said the Sundowns coach.  “We were doing some tests at the club (Sundowns) before we came to camp. I looked at his (Moagi’s) biomechanics and I said ‘how could the supporters select him?’ I was then worried, thinking he’s going to be an embarrassment to our team (Dinaledi FC). But when I looked at the player in training, I was so surprised by how good he is. And I could see him playing for Sundowns in the near future. So you can see the positive spin-offs of the introductions of young players in this kind of space.” With some encouraging words from the Downs coach, this is something the midfielder will take as a positive for his career and to work towards the ultimate goal, which is to graduate to the Brazilians senior team at some point.
