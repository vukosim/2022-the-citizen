Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, has gazetted amendments to Adjusted Alert Level 1 lockdown regulations from midnight on 31 December. Changes to Covid-19 regulations were approved at a special Cabinet meeting on Thursday, when Ramaphosa confirmed curfew would be lifted.  He said all indicators suggest South Africa passed the peak of the fourth wave.  Cabinet made the decision to further ease the regulations following a sustained decrease in infections, hospitalisation and Covid-19 related deaths following the Delta variant, and an increase in vaccinations. The following amendments are now applicable under Adjusted Alert Level 1: “We thank all South Africans who have continued to support government efforts to contain the pandemic. We urge them to continue to do so until the pandemic is completely under control,” said the department in the statement. It urged those who are not yet vaccinated from the age of 12 years to do so urgently in an effort to mitigate the challenges brought by Covid-19.
