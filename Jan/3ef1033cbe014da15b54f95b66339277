Former Mamelodi Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana is understood to be in talks with a Gauteng-based side as he looks to return to the DStv Premiership when the season resumes next month. READ ALSO: ‘Maybe the problem is the yellow jersey’, says Mokwena Kekana, as you would know, parted ways with Masandawana after serving them for nearly a decade. He left the side as Downs coaches could not guarantee him game time, given his age and the stiff competition. A team that remains unknown has shown keen interest, Phakaaathi understands. “Most of the teams in the DStv Premiership would love to have a player of Hlompho’s quality, but the issue is that only a few can afford him. “Never mind his age (36) “KK” has accomplished a lot in his career and he cannot just sign a deal for the sake of it, it has to be worth it,” said a source within Kekana’s camp.
