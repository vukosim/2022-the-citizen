When fans of Real Housewives of Durban were first introduced to Ann Toni Ludick (now Mthembu), she just had her son and was not only adjusting to becoming a mother to yet another child, but was also getting used to a new body.  As a result, she came across as somewhat timid – but the reality star promises that all that is about to change on the new season of Real Housewives of Durban, which premieres today.  In addition to bringing a new surname and new body with her, Ann will be bringing a new friend in the form of Londie London.  Londie is no stranger to the spotlight.  Some years ago, she captured the affection of social media users, thanks to her stunning good looks and unreal figure.She quickly pivoted and made sure to capitalise on that attention which served as her stepping stone into a music career. Some years after she made her debut as an artist, she pivoted once again into a more domesticated life as she became a wife, mother and businesswoman.  Speaking to The Citizen ahead of the new season of Real Housewives of Durban, the pair each promised to bring something new to season two of the reality show.  With Ann, she promises to invite fans into her life in a way that she felt she was not able to in season one.  Londie, on the other hand, enjoys the freedom of a clean slate to introduce her fanbase to more than they have been able to see through her Instagram account.  For both women, however, growth seems to be the word of the year. Growth, and drama.It wouldn’t be a reality show without a little drama, and while both women were coy about whether or not they would be part of any drama this season, it sounded like we can expect to see them get into some trouble. The first episode of Real Housewives of Durban is currently available to stream on Showmax. Click here to stream RHOD Season 2.
