A video of pupils from a secondary school reenacting club culture has gone viral on social media, and Black Coffee as well as the rest of Mzansi cannot get enough of it. Taking to social media, South African DJ and producer Black Coffee shared a video of primary school pupils who reenacted what goes on in the club culture, making use of paper to create all of their fake props.  The video begins by showing the girls arriving at Konka in Soweto, where they receive their fake entrance tags which have the club’s name on them. They then make their way to the entrance where they meet with tiny club bouncers. While walking into the establishment, the girls whip out their phones to record the vibe of the party and to create content for their social media pages, in a way eerily similar to what content creators actually do.

What caught Mzansi as well as Black Coffee’s attention was the little DJ at the club, who wore glasses and was standing behind the decks with his left arm in his pocket while playing music, pretending to be the real Black Coffee.  The video ends with the little club goers partying up a storm, smoking fake hubbly bubblies and taking pictures of themselves to post on their social media pages.  Twitter users were divided by how they felt about the video.  Some thought it was inappropriate for school children to reenact what goes on in in clubs because they were too young to know about club culture, while other people thought the video was innocent, funny and creative.
