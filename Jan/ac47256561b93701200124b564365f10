Its late update having taken place in 2019, when it received the turbocharged Boosterjet engine, Suzuki Auto South Africa has revised the Vitara line-up by eliminating no fewer than four models, thus reducing the local range to three. Despite not providing any reasons for the streamlining, the assumption is that it could potentially have been done to avoid price clashes with the Vitara Brezza. The range now consists of the all-wheel-drive 4Grip GLX and the two GLX Boosterjet models, outfitted with either a manual or automatic gearbox. Models falling by the wayside are GL, GL+ and two-wheel-drive, auto only GLX, all powered by the normally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol engine that makes 86kW/151Nm. The unit, hooked to a five-speed manual gearbox, is, however, retained for the 4Grip GLX with the Boosterjet’s 1.4-litre turbo continuing to produce 103kW/220Nm.

Externally and internally updated back in 2018, the Vitara, which went on sale in 2015, prevails without any specification changes despite the mentioned refresh having taken place four years ago. The axing of the quarter of models has also translated into a higher starting price, with the range now kicking-off at R419 900 instead of the previous R310 900. Pricing for the Boosterjet GLX is unchanged at R426 900 for the manual and R449 900 for the automatic with the provided sticker prices including a five-year/200 000 km warranty as well as a four-year/60 000 km service plan.
