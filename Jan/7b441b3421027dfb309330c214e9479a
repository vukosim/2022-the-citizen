American actor, television host and comedian Nick Cannon could be adding another tiny member to his massive clan after he and a model hosted a gender reveal party over the weekend.  On Sunday afternoon the comedian co-hosted a baby gender reveal party with Bre Tiesi in Malibu, and the occasion was decorated with many baby pink, white and baby blue balloons. Guests who were in attendance where given confetti poppers and were asked to pop them at the same time. Each confetti popper contained blue confetti, which revealed that the baby Bre was having would be a bouncing baby boy.

In December last year, Cannon announced to the world on his daytime show that the five-month-old baby he had with Alyssa Scott had passed away from brain cancer, and also mentioned all the struggles and pain he and Alyssa had to go through with their son, adding that Alyssa was “the strongest woman I’ve ever seen”. Zen was Nick’s 7th child, the 4th child out of Nick’s children that was born in the last year-and-a-half. Nick also welcomed his twins Zillion and Zion in June last year, as well as his daughter Powerpuff some time in December.
