While a Covid-19 outbreak may cost Kaizer Chiefs dearly as they now face a PSL disciplinary hearing over their inability to honour two of their DStv Premiership fixtures in December,  the unfortunate events have worked in almost forgotten hero Nkosingiphile Ngcobo’s favour. ALSO READ: Clean sweep for Sundowns at PSL monthly awardsWith a number of coach Stuart Baxter’s preferred starters unavailable, Ngcobo and a few other youngsters were given a runout by assistant coach Arthur Zwane and Ngcobo grabbed the chance and ran with it, showing that he had been hungry for some game time to prove himself once more.  In the game against Marumo Gallants, Ngcobo scored with a well-taken long range effort and the goal has now won him the Goal-of-the-Month award from the PSL. The goal was voted for by the fans. The 21-year-old credited the goal to team effort. “I think it was a good goal but we created the goal as a team,” said Ngcobo on Monday after getting his award. “The way we shifted and circulated the ball was very good and with Njabulo Blom finding me in the half-spaces, I was able to turn and finish.  “I think I was just there to finish but it was a well-worked goal from the whole team.”
