Cardi B has won some $4 million (R60 739 680.00) in a libel lawsuit in the United States against a celebrity gossip blogger, who posted claims that the superstar rapper was a “prostitute” who had herpes and used cocaine. In 2019 the 29-year-old rapper, born Belcalis Almanzar, had sued the YouTuber Tasha K for posting “malicious rumors” and “degrading and harassing” claims in some 20 videos that referred to the famous artist, according to the lawsuit filed in Georgia’s northern district. Cardi B was awarded roughly $2.75 million – including punitive damages and medical expenses – and additionally approximately $1.3 million over the legal fees, according to court filings over Monday and Tuesday. The YouTuber, born Latasha Kebe, made claims including that the rapper had oral herpes and that her children would be born with intellectual disabilities, assertions that brought her millions of views on YouTube. According to the lawsuit, these caused Cardi B to “suffer embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional distress.” They also brought damage to her “reputation and character within her profession and industry, including but not limited to among her fans and with prospective business relations.” A rapper from the Bronx, Cardi B soared to fame with hits including “Bodak Yellow,” “I Like It” and “Money.” The Grammy winner is also facing ongoing charges in Queens over a strip club brawl case.
