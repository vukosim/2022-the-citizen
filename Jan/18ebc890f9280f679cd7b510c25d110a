Actor turned musician, Naak MusiQ (real name Anga Makubalo), has declared news of his engagement to long time girlfriend Robyn Mentor “fake news.”Naak MusiQ tweeted this in response to a “report” by social media blogger Musa Khawula who assumed that they were engaged based on a recent video shared by Robyn. “I got my ring back” she wrote on a video showing her wearing a halo ring, similar to this Micheal Kors design on her left hand. According to ZAlebs, Naak MusiQ also tweeted and deleted an explanation that read as follows:  “Stop this, she didn’t reveal sh*t. Neither did she make any announcement, neither is it any of your business, to be honest.” “She got that ring with her own money. Where she puts it is her choice. Stay in your lane. WTF!”He seems to have deleted the tweets after it caused some confusion among Twitter users who thought that he was denying the existence of their relationship and not just the misunderstanding that he and Robyn were engaged.
