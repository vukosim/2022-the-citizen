Baroka FC have announced the signing of Ntiyiso Bambo from Limpopo rivals Marumo Gallants.ALSO READ: Baroka table enticing offer to ex-Chiefs star TshabalalaBambo, who played for Gallants’ reserves side in the DStv Diski Challenge, has signed a three-year deal with Bakgaga. At only 19-years old, the young striker from Tzaneen in Limpopo, has been brought into the Baroka set-up to help the club with their goal-scoring problems and help them survive relegation. Bakgaga are currently on position 15 on the log with only 13 points from 17 games and they have only managed to find the back of the net 11 times, while conceding 18 goals. “We are proud to announce the signing of @ntiyisobombi on a 3 year deal. Welcome,” the club wrote on the social media platforms. Baroka will be looking for a change of fortunes in the new year when they resume their 2021/22 DStv Premiership on the 16 February with a clash against Bambo’s former team Gallants in the Limpopo derby at the Peter Mokaba Stadium. The teenager will surely be crossing his fingers to play against his former club. Meanwhile, Baroka will head into this game with their heads held high knowing that the last time they played their neighbours they walked away with a comfortable 2-0 victory thanks to goals by Manuel Kambala and Evidence Makgopa last year. But, before the Gallants match, Baroka will travel down to Cape Town for a clash with Stellenbosch FC in the last 32 round of the Nedbank Cup at the Danie Craven Stadium. The Cup game might be the young player’s chance to make his debut just before going on to face his former employers.
