With exactly two years having passed today (10 January) since the debut of the GR Yaris at the Tokyo Auto Salon, Toyota has provided a teaser image of an even more hardcore model destined for this year’s event. Though unlikely to revive the full-on GRMN moniker, the still extreme model boasts a new, oversized rear wing, what appears to be a more aggressive front bumper and even wider door sills. The most interesting addition tough is an air intake on the bonnet, which has unlocked speculation of a possible power increase from the three-cylinder 1.6-litre turbocharged engine. As it stands, the unit, destined for the incoming GR Corolla, produces 200kW/370Nm in Japan, though detuned in other markets with South African models delivering 198kW/360Nm.

In addition, the online publication alleges the model will come without rear seats and forgo the electronic handbrake for a conventional mechanical system with a traditional lever. Despite the Tokyo Auto Salon commencing this coming Friday (14 January), don’t be surprised if complete details and/or images of the GR Yaris appear online before the official reveal.
