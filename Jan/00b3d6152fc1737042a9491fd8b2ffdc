Jockey Anton Marcus has a very strong hand in the early races at Kenilworth on Monday and could even have three wins on the board by the time the meeting reaches its mid-point. Marcus rides Divine Dynasty for Brett Crawford and Ridgemont in Race 1, a Maiden Plate for fillies and mares over 1000m. The nicely bred three-year-old daughter of Dynasty should get her first win if she continues steady improvement shown thus far. Marcus has partnered her in all three of her races and will know which buttons to press. She drops down in distance, from 1200m to the shorter sprint, but has shown early speed and appears to be a versatile type so that’s unlikely to be a problem. Rock On Captain from the Vaughan Marshall stable and Adam Marcus-trained What A Cherry are the dangers and must inclusions for Trifectas and Quartets. In Race 2, another 1000m Maiden Plate, Marcus teams up with Ridge To Reef for trainer Paddy Kruyer. This gelding is a son of Rafeef, stallion making a big name for himself in sprints. Ridge to Reef has shown good improvement since being fitted with cheekpieces and blinkers and he looks likely to break his duck at the sixth attempt. Marcus could pay a third visit to the winners’ circle in the fourth, a maiden affair over 1600m, with Crawford charge Sage King. This grey by Dynasty has gone third, second, second in his last three outings – all when partnered by Marcus. Gelding seems to have got the three-year-old’s mind on the job and the only potential problem is a No 11 draw going into the Kenilworth left-hand bend. Candice Bass-Robinson-trained Silent War could be the one to pounce if things go wrong for Sage King.
