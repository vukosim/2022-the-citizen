Reports of fire at the SA National Defence Force (SANDF) Waterkloof Airbase in Pretoria emerged on Sunday, although the Tshwane fire department said it hasn’t received any alert about the blaze. Spokesperson Roland Fredericks said a truck has been sent to the base to investigate. “I just spoke to emergency control room, no fire has been reported in the past couple of hours. We did send a vehicle to investigate whether there is a fire, or possible grass fire around the base.  “We will send out an update as soon as we receive any further information,” he told The Citizen on Sunday night. Anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee tweeted a photograph of a fire burning, saying it was at the airbase.  Other users posted video clips. The latest fire incident sent fears that there could be another attack on another National Key Point. Sections of the Parliament building and the Constitutional Court were attacked in the past few weeks, revealing an inefficient crime intelligence service. A hammer was used to smash windows and doors at the entrance of the apex court a day after Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo handed the first part of the state capture report. The Old and New Assembly buildings of Parliament were destroyed by a fire on 2 January fire that raged on for two days. This is a developing story. Updates to follow as more information is made available.
