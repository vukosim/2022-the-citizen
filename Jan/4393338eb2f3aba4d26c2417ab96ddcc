With the replacement for the Aventador being a plug-in hybrid when it debuts next year, Lamborghini has revealed that its final new internal combustion only model will become a reality this year. In making the announcement to Automotive News Europe, the Raging Bull’s CEO, Stephan Winkelmann, said 2022 will be marked by the unveiling of four models, though it remains unknown which model will be final petrol-fuelled only Lamborghini. At present, reports hint at a Evo version of the Urus or possibly yet another special edition Huracan supplementing the Evo and STO derivatives launched in 2020. “In 2023-2024, we will hybridise all our product line-up to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 50% by 2025,” Winkelmann told Britain’s Autocar last year.

In yet another confirmation, Winkelmann said the brand is still developing its next all-new model, which in 2019 was reported to be production version of the Estoque sedan Sant’Agata cancelled in 2008. Based on unconfirmed reports, the Estoque has already been identified as the model that will spearhead Lamborghini’s electric switch, though as mentioned, nothing has been set in stone. Expect more details about it, as well as the four new models, to emerge over the coming weeks and months as either official teasers or rumours.
