Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we only ever craved broccoli, fruit, chicken breasts and kale? Giving up your favourite foods is probably one of the hardest things to do, but it’s something we all consider at one point or another during the year. Some of us manage to train our taste buds to enjoy healthier foods quite successfully, while others give in to their cravings for chocolate, ice cream and all things nice after only a couple of days. Research shows that fewer than 50% of people who make a New Year’s resolution will have stuck to it three months in. But what if it was possible to still have your chocolate and eat it, without gaining weight? Yes, you read that correctly, you don’t have to ditch your chocolate to drop a dress size – you just need to change the colour of your chocolate. If you simply cannot live without your block of chocolate every night after dinner, you should consider switching to dark chocolate as it contains higher levels of cocoa and less sugar. Research has also shown that dark chocolate can help you control consumption after you eat. The same applies to other foods as well. You don’t have to give up your favourite foods, you just need to prepare them in a healthier way for a while to train your brain to enjoy those flavours instead.
