A shooting incident on Friday at Amaoti, in Inanda, has claimed the lives of six men aged between 17 and 26 years old. A vehicle with three people inside pulled up at a local tuck shop where the men were seated and opened fire. Police at Inanda are investigating six counts of murder.  “At this stage information gathered from the scene indicates that the deceased was seated behind the tuck shop, consuming drugs and that the attack might be drug-related,” said Naicker. “We are appealing to anyone who may have information with regards to the identity of the deceased to contact police at Inanda or Crime stop on 08600 10111.” The African National Congress said it is concerned about continuous mass shootings and killings in the province. “One of the major challenges confronting our communities is the issue of drug abuse and drug lords fighting for territorial control to trade with impunity and pursue their criminal acts,” said party spokesperson in KZN Nhlakanipho Ntombela. ” We call on the government and police, in particular, to close space and squeeze these criminals wherever they are found.” Compiled by Narissa Subramoney NOW READ: Another taxi owner gunned down in KwaZulu-Natal
