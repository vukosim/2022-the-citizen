Limpopo-based DStv Premiership side Baroka FC have announced the departure of two players, with immediate effect.ALSO READ: Swallows show interest in Kaizer Chiefs youngster Winger Joslin Kamatuka and defender Elliot Seema will now have to seek for new homes after parting ways with Bakgaga. “Baroka Football Club has parted ways with forward Joslin Kamatuka and defender Elliot Seema with immediate effect. We take this opportunity to wish them well in their future endeavours,” said the club in a statement. Kamatuka joined Baroka early last year following a short spell in the GladAfrica Championship with Cape Umoya United. But, the Namibian born winger failed to make an impact at the Limpopo-based club, with only eight appearances for the club since his arrival. Meanwhile, Seema, who broke into the professional football ranks thanks to varsity football where he played for Tshwane University of Technology, was also deemed surplus to requirements by Baroka, after signing with the team in September last year. The 28-year-old defender is well-travelled having also played for teams such as Highlands Park, Swallows FC and Polokwane City in top flight football. With the league campaign only resuming mid-February due to the Africa Cup of Nations playing in Cameroon, the pair has some time to look out for new clubs where they will be hoping to get long term contracts and most importantly, get more game time.
