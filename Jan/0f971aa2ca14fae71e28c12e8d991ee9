If one of your New Year’s resolutions is to lose weight and live healthier, chances are that you’ve come across a gazillion smoothie recipes already. But not all smoothies are created equally. When it comes to eating for weight-loss and burning fat there is a specific science behind the ingredients that should be included in your smoothies. It’s important not to add too many fruit sugars to your smoothie (some fruits are much higher in sugar than others) as this will spike your blood sugars and before you know it, you’ll abandon your healthy mindset because you are starving. A good rule of thumb to follow is to add one fruit serving, or less, to your smoothie at a time. This can be either one frozen banana or half a frozen banana and half a cup frozen berries. You don’t have to use frozen fruits, they do, however, improve the texture of your smoothie. The frozen fruits should also not contain any added sugars. Your second ingredient should be in the form of leafy greens and vegetables for fibre. Your third ingredient should contain healthy fats like avocado, ground flax or chia seeds, and almond butter, as these will keep you full between meals.
