Phakaaathi has learnt that while Orlando Pirates defender Olisa Ndah played only 25 minutes for Nigeria at Afcon in Cameroon, he already has European scouts tracking him. ALSO READ: Jele keen to stay as Orlando Pirates contract nears end A source has revealed that scouts from a team whose name we could not establish as yet were following Ndah even at the Super Eagles training sessions.  “Apparently they took notice of him last season while he was playing in Nigeria and they followed him in Cameroon. No one knows what will happen but everyone seems to think he is good enough for a move overseas.  “From what I have read about him in South Africa, I think he is doing well there as well. But we will wait and see what happens,” said the source.  Ndah has been a revelation for Orlando Pirates as he has brought some much needed stability at the back. And he still has age on his side as he just turned 24 last week.
