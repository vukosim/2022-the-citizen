The Brakenfell police officer who allegedly raped a domestic violence victim is expected to appear in the Bluedowns Magistrate’s Court on Monday. The woman had gone to the police station to lay a complaint against her abusive partner, but was never assisted and went back home, according to the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Cape Town. “She went back to the abusive partner. While at her partner’s place, she called the police again as the situation was becoming unbearable and overwhelming for her.  “The police officer arrived at the place where she made the call from and after having assessed the situation, the officer offered that he would take her to a safer location,” spokesperson Andiswa Madikazi said in a statement.
