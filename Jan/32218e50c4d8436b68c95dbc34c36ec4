Newly crowned SA Rugby Player of the Year for 2021, Siya Kolisi, is back in the Sharks team for Saturday’s United Rugby Championship match against the Stormers in Durban. Also back in the side is Bongi Mbonambi, thee Bok hooker. Both men missed last week’s victory against the Lions in Joburg. They will come up against their former team-mates in the highly-anticipated match at Kings Park.

And we also managed the game well at times and that was why we came out on top.” Besides the changes at flank and hooker, the rest of the squad remains unchanged from last week.Sharks: Aphelele Fassi, Sbu Nkosi, Lukhanyo Am (capt), Ben Tapuai, Makazole Mapimpi, Boeta Chamberlain, Grant Williams, Phepsi Buthulezi, Jeandre Labuschagne, Siya Kolisi, Hyron Andrews, Ruben van Heerden, Thomas du Toit, Bongi Mbonambi, Ox Nche.
