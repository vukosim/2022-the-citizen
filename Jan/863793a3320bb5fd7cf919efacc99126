Three armed robbers were gunned down on Thursday night during a shootout with police in Tonga, Mpumalanga. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the group of heavily armed suspects on Thursday charged into a local supermarket at Block A in Tonga, and looted cigarettes, television sets, airtime as well as an undisclosed amount of cash. Thereafter they fled the scene in a white Ford Bantam and the robbery was reported to the police, who responded swiftly and searched for the suspects.  ALSO READ: Six prisoners escape custody after armed men ambush police van Police spotted the armed robbers driving in the vehicle which matched the description of the white Ford Bantam used to flee the scene.
