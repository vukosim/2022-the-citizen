New Sekhukhune United signing Justin Shonga is looking at picking up the pieces following a difficult few months at his last three teams.ALSO READ: Sekhukhune announce three new signings Prior to joining Sekhukhune, Shonga only spent three months with Egyptian Premier League side Ismaily, where unpaid salaries forced him out of the club. The former Orlando Pirates striker also had short stints with Tshakuma Tsha Madzivhandila and Cape Town City before moving to the Northern part of the continent. “It’s a good feeling to be back in the DStv Premiership because here in South Africa it feels like home, it’s different to when I was playing for Ismaily. The environment there it’s not that good football wise, but in terms of if you want to focus on football it’s fine, but here (South Africa) it’s suitable for me because it feels like home and I have experienced this league before, so it’s a good feeling,” said Shonga. “I wouldn’t promise much because I have to know the team, how it plays. Besides that, the DStv Premiership is a league I have played in before. So, I just want to help the team get more points because they are doing well at the moment. So, I just want to help them to keep on going and doing more, getting my form back, focusing on myself, working hard and helping the team,” added the former Orlando Pirates striker. Shonga made a name for himself in the PSL with the Buccaneers in 2017 after joining them from Zambia’s Nkwazi FC. He parted ways with the Soweto giants in 2020 and a move to Tshakhuma before moving to the Mother City in January last year to join Cape Town City.
