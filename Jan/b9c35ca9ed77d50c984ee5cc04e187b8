Kairo Forbes, daughter of hip hop artist Kiernan “AKA” Forbes and South African Dj and producer Dj Zinhle has been a style icon since birth and we can say that she definitely got it all from her parents.  From princess dresses and Halloween consumes, to stylish sunglasses and colourful braids, Kairo has warmed South Africa’s hearts on multiple occasions with her social media posts which are shared on her Instagram account managed by her grandmother, Lynn Forbes.  The little fashionista wore a brown T-shirt, brown shorts and a brown coat while on a safari getaway and paired the outfit with a pair of original timberland boots, as well as some junior sunglasses. Kairo is known to dress up according to theme for special occasions, parties and holidays, and in this next picture she is wearing a pink princess costume dress with a pair of glasses which she and her “glammy” Lynn Forbes got from Dj Zinhle’s fashion brand called Era By Dj Zinhle.
