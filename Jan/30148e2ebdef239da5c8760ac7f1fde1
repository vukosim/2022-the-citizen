The Rand decreased in value to the dollar during the period between 26 November and 30 December 2021 compared to the same period in the previous year. “The average Rand/US Dollar exchange rate for the period 26 November 2021 to 30 December 2021 was 15.9196 compared to 15.3891 during the previous period. This led to a higher contribution to the Basic Fuel Prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 29.95 c/l, 29.33 c/l and 29.01 c/l respectively,” the statement reads.
